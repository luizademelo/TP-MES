Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

# Defines a Status structure to represent operation status/result in gRPC
# The Struct includes:
#   :code - The status code (typically an enum value representing success/failure)
#   :details - Additional details about the status (human-readable message)
#   :metadata - Optional metadata associated with the status
#   :debug_error_string - Debug information string for error cases
Struct.new('Status', :code, :details, :metadata, :debug_error_string)
```

I've made the following improvements:
1. Fixed the incomplete license comment (added missing "Unless required by applicable law..." line)
2. Added a clear comment explaining the purpose of the Status struct
3. Added comments explaining each of the struct members
4. Maintained consistent comment formatting

The comments now clearly explain that this is defining a structure to represent operation status in gRPC, with explanations of what each field represents.
