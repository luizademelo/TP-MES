module GRPC
  module Core
    # Contains status code constants for gRPC operations.
    # These codes follow the gRPC protocol specification and are used to indicate
    # the success or failure of RPC operations.
    module StatusCodes
      # The operation completed successfully
      OK = 0

      # The operation was cancelled (typically by the caller)
      CANCELLED = 1

      # Unknown error. An example of where this error may be returned is
      # if a Status value received from another address space belongs to
      # an error-space that is not known in this address space
      UNKNOWN = 2

      # Client specified an invalid argument. Note that this differs
      # from FAILED_PRECONDITION. INVALID_ARGUMENT indicates arguments
      # that are problematic regardless of the state of the system.
      INVALID_ARGUMENT = 3

      # Deadline expired before operation could complete. For operations
      # that change the state of the system, this error may be returned
      # even if the operation has completed successfully.
      DEADLINE_EXCEEDED = 4

      # Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was not found
      NOT_FOUND = 5

      # Some entity that we attempted to create (e.g., file or directory)
      # already exists
      ALREADY_EXISTS = 6

      # The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation.

      # some resource (use RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED instead).
      PERMISSION_DENIED = 7

      # perhaps the entire file system is out of space.

      # Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
      # required for the operation's execution.
      FAILED_PRECONDITION = 9

      # The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue
      # like sequencer check failures, transaction aborts, etc.
      ABORTED = 10

      # Operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or
      # reading past end of file.
      OUT_OF_RANGE = 11

      # Operation is not implemented or not supported/enabled in this service.
      UNIMPLEMENTED = 12

      # Internal errors. Means some invariants expected by underlying
      # system has been broken. If you see one of these errors,
      # something is very broken.
      INTERNAL = 13

      # The service is currently unavailable. This is most likely a
      # transient condition which may be corrected by retrying with
      # a backoff.
      UNAVAILABLE = 14

      # Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.
      DATA_LOSS = 15

      # The request does not have valid authentication credentials
      # for the operation.
      UNAUTHENTICATED = 16

The comments provide:
1. An overall description of the module's purpose
2. Detailed explanations for each status code constant
3. Clarification about when each status might be used
4. Distinctions between similar status codes
5. Notes about proper usage where applicable

The comments follow gRPC's standard status code documentation while being formatted for Ruby code readability.
