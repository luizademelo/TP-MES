Key explanations added:
1. The purpose of the GRPC_ENABLE_FORK_SUPPORT environment variable
2. The platform restriction for Linux
3. Path setup and load path modifications
4. Purpose of each required library
5. The fork workflow including pre-fork, post-fork child, and post-fork parent operations
6. Process synchronization between parent and child
7. The overall structure and flow of the program

The comments maintain a balance between explaining what the code does and why certain operations are performed, which is particularly important for the fork-related operations that can be tricky to understand.
