Key aspects explained in the comments:
1. The purpose of the test (validating gRPC class initialization)
2. The list of core gRPC classes being tested
3. The test loop structure (4 iterations to catch race conditions)
4. The two test modes (normal and garbage collection stress)
5. Process spawning and timeout handling
6. Exit code verification logic
7. The overall test flow and error handling

The comments provide context for each major section while explaining the rationale behind specific implementation choices.
