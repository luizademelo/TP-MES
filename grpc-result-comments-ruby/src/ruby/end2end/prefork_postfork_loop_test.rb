Key comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of enabling fork support
2. Clarified the Linux platform restriction
3. Documented the path setup for libraries
4. Explained the $LOAD_PATH modifications
5. Added descriptions for each required library
6. Documented the main test loop and its purpose
7. Explained the gRPC fork-related function calls
8. Added a note about the test being a stress test (10,000 iterations)

The comments provide context about what the code is doing and why, which will help future developers understand and maintain this test script.
