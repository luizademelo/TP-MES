Key aspects explained in the comments:
1. The overall purpose as an end-to-end test scenario
2. The server-client architecture being tested
3. The intentional abrupt termination test case
4. The timeout and forced kill logic for handling unresponsive clients
5. The error handling and reporting mechanism
6. The cleanup sequence

The comments maintain the original functionality while making the test's purpose and flow clear to future maintainers.
