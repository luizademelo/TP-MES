Key comments added:
1. Explained the overall purpose of the script
2. Documented the command line argument parsing
3. Clarified the purpose of the thread and gRPC call
4. Noted the expected behavior (SIGTERM interruption)
5. Added context for the port reporting function
6. Explained the main execution flow

The comments maintain the original functionality while making the code's purpose and behavior clearer for future maintainers.
