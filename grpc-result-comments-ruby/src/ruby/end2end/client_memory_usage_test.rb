# Main function to execute the client-server memory usage test

  # Start the gRPC server

```

Key improvements made:
1. Added clear section headers for license and main function
2. Documented each significant operation
3. Explained the purpose of the ensure block
4. Added comments about error handling
5. Clarified the flow of the test (server startup -> client run -> cleanup)
6. Added explanation for the client exit code check
7. Noted the purpose of the require_relative statement

The comments now provide a clear understanding of the test's structure and purpose while maintaining readability.
