Key comments added:
1. Explained the overall purpose of the script
2. Documented the server startup process
3. Explained the client process creation
4. Detailed the timeout and error handling logic
5. Added notes about the exit code checking
6. Documented the server cleanup
7. Noted the main execution call

The comments focus on explaining the control flow and the purpose of each section, particularly around the client-server interaction and error handling scenarios.
