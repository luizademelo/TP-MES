Key comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of enabling fork support and Linux requirement
2. Documented the path setup logic
3. Added descriptions for required libraries
4. Documented the RPC function and its error handling
5. Added detailed comments for the main execution flow including:
   - Stub creation
   - Pre-fork setup
   - Child process operations
   - Parent process operations
6. Noted the purpose of each logging operation
7. Added high-level comments for the overall structure

The comments maintain a consistent style and provide both high-level overview and specific details where needed.
