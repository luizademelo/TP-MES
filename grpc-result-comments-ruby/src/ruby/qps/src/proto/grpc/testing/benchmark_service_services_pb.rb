Key additions in the comments:
1. Added explanation of the overall module structure
2. Documented the purpose of the Service class
3. Explained the serialization configuration
4. Added detailed comments for each RPC method type:
   - Unary RPC
   - Bidirectional streaming
   - Client streaming
   - Server streaming
   - Memory snapshot RPC
5. Explained the stub class generation
6. Added clarification about required libraries

The comments provide clear explanations of each component while maintaining readability and following Ruby conventions.
