Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

# GRPC module namespace
module GRPC
  # NativeDebug module for platform-specific debugging functionality
  module NativeDebug
    # Constant to hold platform-specific debug information
    # Note: Currently incomplete - needs platform value assignment
    PLATFORM =
  end
end
```

Comments added:
1. Added a note about the license section being standard Apache 2.0 boilerplate
2. Added description of the GRPC module namespace
3. Explained the purpose of the NativeDebug module
4. Documented the PLATFORM constant and noted that it's currently incomplete (missing value assignment)
5. Improved formatting with consistent indentation and spacing

The code appears to be a stub/incomplete implementation, likely part of a larger codebase for gRPC's Ruby implementation. The PLATFORM constant is clearly meant to hold some platform-specific debug information but hasn't been fully implemented yet.
