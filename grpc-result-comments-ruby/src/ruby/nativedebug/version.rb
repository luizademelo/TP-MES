Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

# GRPC module namespace
module GRPC
  # NativeDebug module containing version information for gRPC's native debug components
  module NativeDebug
    # Current version string for the gRPC native debug components
    # Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[.dev] (development version marked with .dev suffix)
    VERSION = '1.74.0.dev'
  end
end
```

The comments I've added:
1. Added a missing line in the license header for completeness
2. Added explanation of the GRPC module namespace
3. Added documentation for the NativeDebug module and its purpose
4. Added detailed documentation for the VERSION constant including format explanation
5. Maintained all existing code structure while making it more understandable

The comments follow Ruby conventions and provide clear context about the version information while preserving all legal requirements from the license header.
