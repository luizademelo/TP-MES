The comments explain:
1. The overall purpose of the test file
2. The helper method for case conversion
3. The test iteration through all status codes
4. The expectations being verified for each status code
5. The key operations being performed in each test case

The comments are placed to help future developers understand:
- Why the test exists
- What each part of the test is doing
- What the expected behavior should be
- How the test verifies the functionality
