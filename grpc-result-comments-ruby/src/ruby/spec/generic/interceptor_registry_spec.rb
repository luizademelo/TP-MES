Key improvements made:
1. Added file-level description explaining this is a test suite for GRPC::InterceptorRegistry
2. Added comments for each test setup variable (server, interceptor, etc.)
3. Added clear section headers for different test contexts
4. Explained what each test is verifying
5. Added comments for the expected behavior in each test case
6. Clarified the purpose of instance variable access in tests
7. Added notes about test data ordering and validation
8. Explained the error case testing

The comments now make it much clearer what each part of the test is doing and why, which will help future maintainers understand and modify the tests.
