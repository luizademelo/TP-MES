# Add the current directory to the Ruby load path to allow requiring local files
this_dir = File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))
$LOAD_PATH.unshift(this_dir) unless $LOAD_PATH.include?(this_dir)

# Require the gRPC library and the generated echo service stub
require 'grpc'
require 'echo_services_noprotobuf'

# Main method that demonstrates a simple gRPC client
def main
  # Create a gRPC stub (client) to communicate with the server running on localhost:50051
  # Using an insecure channel (no encryption) for demonstration purposes
  stub = EchoWithoutProtobuf::Stub.new('localhost:50051', :this_channel_is_insecure)
  
  # Get the user argument from command line or default to 'world'
  user = ARGV.size > 0 ?  ARGV[0] : 'world'
  
  # Call the echo RPC method on the server with a greeting message
  message = stub.echo("hello #{user}")
  
  # Print the server's response
  p "Response: #{message}"
end

# Execute the main method
main
```

Key comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of modifying the load path
2. Documented the required dependencies
3. Added detailed comments for the main method and its components
4. Explained the gRPC stub creation and its parameters
5. Clarified the command line argument handling
6. Documented the RPC call and response handling

The comments maintain a clear and concise style while providing useful context for future developers who might need to understand or modify this code.
