Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

# Require the gRPC library and the generated protobuf files
require 'grpc'
require 'helloworld_pb'

# Module namespace for the HelloWorld service
module Helloworld
  # Submodule for the Greeter service
  module Greeter

    # Service class that implements the gRPC service interface
    class Service
      # Include the GenericService module from gRPC to provide base functionality
      include GRPC::GenericService

      # Configure marshaling (serialization) methods for the service
      # These methods will be used to encode/decode messages
      self.marshal_class_method = :encode
      self.unmarshal_class_method = :decode
      
      # Define the service name that will be used in the gRPC protocol
      self.service_name = 'helloworld.Greeter'

      # Define the RPC method 'SayHello' that takes a HelloRequest and returns a HelloReply
      rpc :SayHello, HelloRequest, HelloReply
    end

    # Create a client stub class for the service that clients can use to make RPC calls
    Stub = Service.rpc_stub_class
  end
end
```

Key comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of each require statement
2. Documented the module and class hierarchy
3. Explained the GenericService inclusion and its purpose
4. Clarified the marshaling configuration
5. Explained the service_name setting
6. Documented the RPC method definition
7. Explained the purpose of the Stub class generation

The comments maintain a clear and professional tone while providing useful information about each component of the service definition. They explain both what the code is doing and why it's important in the context of gRPC service implementation.
