```

Key improvements made:
1. Added comprehensive docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and behavior
2. Added comments explaining each significant step in the function
3. Fixed the license header formatting (added missing # on empty lines)
4. Clarified the meaning of the acceptable status codes
5. Added comments about the temporary file usage
6. Made the error message more visible by putting it before the exit

The comments now provide clear guidance for future maintainers about:
- The function's overall purpose
- What constitutes successful execution
- How the temporary file is used
- The error handling behavior
- The expected format of input commands
