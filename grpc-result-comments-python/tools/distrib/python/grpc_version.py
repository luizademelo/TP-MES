VERSION = '1.74.0.dev0'

// Version of Protocol Buffers (protobuf) that this gRPC version is compatible with

```

The comments added:
1. Explained the copyright and license block
2. Added documentation for the VERSION constant, explaining its format
3. Added documentation for PROTOBUF_VERSION, explaining its purpose and relationship to gRPC

The comments are concise yet provide important context about version numbering and dependencies that would be helpful for maintenance.
