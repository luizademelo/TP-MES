Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is primarily a license header, I'll add comments explaining its purpose:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors, indicating ownership and year of creation
# Copyright 2016 gRPC authors.

// License header for Apache License, Version 2.0
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");

// Notice that usage of this file is restricted to compliance with the License
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

```

These comments explain each line of the standard Apache License 2.0 header, which is commonly used in open source projects. The header serves several legal purposes:
1. Declares copyright ownership
2. Specifies the license terms
3. Provides a reference to the full license text
4. Includes necessary disclaimers
5. States the limitations of liability
