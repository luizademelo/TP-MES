The comments explain:
1. The overall purpose of the module (handling Windows command line limits)
2. The constant value for Windows command line limit
3. The monkey-patching approach
4. The modified spawn method's logic:
   - Windows-specific compiler flag adjustments
   - Command length calculation
   - Temporary file creation for long commands
   - Command escaping and file writing
   - Cleanup of temporary resources
5. The fallback to original behavior when not needed

The comments are placed to help future maintainers understand both the high-level purpose and the detailed implementation choices.
