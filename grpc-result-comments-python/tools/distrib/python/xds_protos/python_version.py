Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

# List of Python versions officially supported by this project
# These versions are tested and guaranteed to work with the codebase
SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS = ["3.9","3.10","3.11","3.12","3.13"]

# Minimum Python version required for this project to function properly
# Versions below this may lack required features or have compatibility issues
MIN_PYTHON_VERSION = 3.9

# Maximum Python version officially supported by this project
# Versions above this may work but aren't officially tested/supported
MAX_PYTHON_VERSION = 3.13
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS list
2. The significance of MIN_PYTHON_VERSION as the lower compatibility boundary
3. The significance of MAX_PYTHON_VERSION as the upper compatibility boundary

I've also fixed the formatting of the license header comments to be consistent (all lines starting with #) and fixed a typo in the variable name SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS (removed an extra P).
