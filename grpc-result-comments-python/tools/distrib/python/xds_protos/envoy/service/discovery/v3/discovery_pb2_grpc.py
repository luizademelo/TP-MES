Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
"""Client and server classes corresponding to protobuf-defined services."""
# This module provides the necessary classes and functionality for creating
# gRPC clients and servers based on Protocol Buffer (protobuf) service definitions.
# It serves as the main interface between Python code and gRPC's core functionality.

import grpc
# The grpc module is the core Python package for gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call),
# which enables client-server communication. It provides the fundamental building blocks
# for creating and interacting with gRPC services, including:
# - Channel creation and management
# - Server implementation
# - Stub generation for client-side communication
# - Various utilities for asynchronous operations
