Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
"""
Client and server classes corresponding to protobuf-defined services.

This module provides the auto-generated gRPC client and server stub classes
that correspond to service definitions in Protocol Buffers (.proto files).
These classes handle the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) communication between
client and server applications.

The grpc import provides the core gRPC functionality needed to create
and manage channels, make RPC calls, and implement services.
"""
import grpc  # Google's gRPC Python library for building RPC clients/servers
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the auto-generated code
2. What functionality this module provides
3. The role of Protocol Buffers
4. The purpose of the grpc import
5. Additional context about gRPC's role in RPC communication
