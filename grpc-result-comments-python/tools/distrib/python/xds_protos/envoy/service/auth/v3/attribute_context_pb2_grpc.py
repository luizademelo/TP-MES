Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
"""
Client and server classes corresponding to protobuf-defined services.

This module provides the necessary classes and functionality to create gRPC 
clients and servers based on Protocol Buffer (protobuf) service definitions.
The generated client and server classes handle the RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
communication between services.

Key imports:
- grpc: The main gRPC Python package that provides core functionality for
  creating and managing gRPC channels, servers, and RPC stubs.
"""
import grpc  # Google's gRPC library for building RPC servers and clients
```

The comments provide:
1. A clear description of the module's purpose
2. Explanation of what the generated classes are used for
3. Documentation of the key import
4. A brief note about the grpc import's functionality

The comments are concise yet informative enough to help future developers understand the purpose and context of this code snippet.
