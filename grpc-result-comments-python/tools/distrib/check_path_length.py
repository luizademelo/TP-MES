Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added explanation of the purpose of each section
2. Explained the git command being used
3. Clarified the error handling logic
4. Noted the implicit success case (exit 0)
5. Added comments for variable declarations and their purposes
6. Explained the control flow and decision points

The comments now make it clear that this is a path length validation script for git repositories, which helps maintainers understand its purpose and behavior at a glance.
