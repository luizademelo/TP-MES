Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added explanation of the script's overall purpose (checking and fixing include paths)
2. Documented each major section of the code
3. Explained the logic behind each significant operation
4. Clarified the purpose of variables and flags
5. Added details about the command line arguments
6. Explained the error handling and exit behavior
7. Maintained the existing license header and shebang line

The comments are concise but comprehensive, helping future maintainers understand both what the code does and why it does it.
