Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added explanation of the purpose of each directory in `_TARGET_DIRS`
2. Documented what types of files are considered "interesting"
3. Explained the two main validation checks being performed:
   - Checking for README.md files in directories
   - Checking for Doxygen `\file` tags in source files
4. Added comments about the banner printing logic
5. Explained the error counting and final assertion
6. Added context about the project root directory calculation

The comments now provide clear explanations of:
- What the code is checking for
- Why these checks are important
- How the checks are implemented
- The structure of the output when errors are found
