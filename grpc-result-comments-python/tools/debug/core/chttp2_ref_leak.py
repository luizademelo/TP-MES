# Function that returns a new list with "destroy" as its only element
# This is used as the default_factory for the defaultdict
def new_obj():
    return ["destroy"]

# defaultdict that tracks outstanding references to objects
# Each new key will automatically initialize with ["destroy"] as its value
outstanding = collections.defaultdict(new_obj)

# Process each line from standard input
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Use regex to match lines containing reference/dereference operations
    # The pattern matches:
    # 1. "chttp2:" prefix

    # 3. Hex address (0x...)
    # 4. Arbitrary text until [
    # 5. Contents inside brackets

            # For dereference operations: remove the operation from the object's list
            outstanding[m.group(2)].remove(m.group(3))

# After processing all input, check for leaks
# A leak is detected if any object has remaining operations beyond the initial "destroy"
for obj, remaining in list(outstanding.items()):
    if remaining:
        # Print leaked objects with their remaining operations
        print(("LEAKED: %s %r" % (obj, remaining)))

Key points explained in the comments:
1. The purpose of the `new_obj()` function and how it's used with defaultdict
2. The structure and purpose of the `outstanding` defaultdict
3. The regex pattern breakdown and what each part matches
4. The reference/dereference handling logic
5. The leak detection mechanism at the end
6. The meaning of the output format for leaked objects

The comments explain both the high-level purpose of the code (tracking object references to detect leaks) and the implementation details of how it accomplishes this.
