Key aspects documented:
1. Overall purpose of the script (tracking error states)
2. Input handling (reading from stdin)
3. Error state tracking list initialization
4. Line processing logic:
   - Pattern matching for error lines
   - Data extraction and cleaning
5. Three main operations handled:
   - Error creation
   - Error reallocation
   - Error destruction
6. Final output showing leaked errors

The comments explain both the high-level flow and specific implementation details, making it easier for future maintainers to understand and modify the code.
