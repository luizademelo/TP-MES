Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the overall purpose
2. Added detailed function docstrings explaining parameters and return values
3. Added comments for complex logic sections
4. Explained the regular expression pattern
5. Clarified the Mako plugin functionality
6. Documented the main script behavior
7. Maintained all existing license and copyright information

The comments now provide clear explanations while maintaining the original functionality. They follow Python docstring conventions and provide useful information for future maintainers.
