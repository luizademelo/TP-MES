"""Buildgen .proto files list plugin.

a list called "protos" that contains all of the proto file names.

    Some projects generators may want to get the full list of unique .proto files

    a list called "protos".

Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added detailed docstring for the function parameters and behavior
2. Explained the purpose of the regular expression
3. Clarified why a set is used (for automatic deduplication)
4. Added comments for each processing loop
5. Explained the final sorting step
6. Noted the in-place modification of the dictionary
7. Maintained all existing documentation while adding implementation details

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- What the code does at a high level
- How it processes the input data
- Why certain implementation choices were made
- What the expected output will be
