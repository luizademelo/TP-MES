Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added explanation for the `__future__` import
2. Documented each import's purpose
3. Explained the file_list variable and its preprocessing nature
4. Added docstring for the TestFilesMatch class
5. Added detailed docstring for the testFilesMatch method
6. Explained the main execution block's logic for both normal test execution and --fix mode
7. Maintained all original copyright and license information

The comments now provide clear context about the code's purpose and functionality while maintaining readability.
