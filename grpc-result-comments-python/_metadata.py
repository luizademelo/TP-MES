Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Define the version number of the software package
// Format follows semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
// The ".dev0" suffix indicates this is a development version (pre-release)
// Current version: 1.74.0 in development stage (not a stable release)
__version__ = """1.74.0.dev0"""
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the variable (to store package version)
2. The versioning scheme being used
3. The meaning of each version component
4. The significance of the ".dev0" suffix
5. The current version's status as a development version
