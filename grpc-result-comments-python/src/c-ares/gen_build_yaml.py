Key improvements made in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the overall purpose
2. Added detailed function docstrings explaining each function's purpose and behavior
3. Added comments for the dictionary structure and important fields
4. Explained the error handling approach
5. Clarified the YAML output purpose
6. Added comments for important code blocks and logic

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- The code's purpose (generating build configuration for c-ares library)
- How platform-specific configurations are handled
- The structure of the output YAML
- The error handling strategy
- The role of each function and configuration parameter
