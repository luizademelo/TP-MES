# Import required modules
import os  # For operating system related functionality
import yaml  # For YAML file parsing and dumping

# Construct the absolute path to the preprocessed_builds.yaml file
# by joining the directory of this script with the filename
BUILDS_YAML_PATH = os.path.join(
    os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "preprocessed_builds.yaml"
)

# Open and safely load the YAML file content
with open(BUILDS_YAML_PATH) as f:
    builds = yaml.safe_load(f)  # Parse YAML content into Python dictionary

# Process each build entry in the loaded YAML data
for build in builds:
    # Set default values for each build entry:
    build["build"] = "private"  # Mark build as private
    build["build_system"] = []  # Initialize empty build system list
    build["language"] = "c"  # Set default language to C
    build["secure"] = False  # Mark build as non-secure by default

# Convert the modified builds dictionary back to YAML format
# and print it with a "libs" root element
print(yaml.dump({"libs": builds}))
```

Key comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of imports
2. Documented the YAML path construction
3. Explained the YAML loading process
4. Documented the build entry processing loop and default values
5. Explained the final YAML output conversion

The comments maintain a clear flow that follows the execution path of the script while explaining both the what and why of each operation.
