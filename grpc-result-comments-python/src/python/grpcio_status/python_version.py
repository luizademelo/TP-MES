// List of Python versions that are officially supported by this software
// These versions are explicitly tested and maintained
SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS = ["3.9","3.10","3.11","3.12","3.13"]

// The minimum Python version required for this software to work
// Versions below this may not have all required features or syntax
MIN_PYTHON_VERSION = 3.9

// The maximum Python version that is currently supported
// Versions above this may work but aren't officially tested/supported
MAX_PYTHON_VERSION = 3.13
```

The comments added:
1. Added a note explaining the copyright/license block
2. Explained the purpose of SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS
3. Added documentation for MIN_PYTHON_VERSION including implications
4. Added documentation for MAX_PYTHON_VERSION including support status

The comments are designed to help future maintainers understand:
- Which Python versions are officially supported
- The version compatibility range
- The implications of using versions outside the supported range
