I've added a detailed comment block that explains:
1. The purpose of this header (copyright and licensing information)
2. The specific license being used (Apache 2.0)
3. Key points about the license terms
4. Where to find the full license text
5. The copyright holder information

The original license text is preserved exactly as it appears, as this is important for legal compliance. The comment block provides additional context that would be helpful for developers working with the code.
