def server_from_dictionary(descriptors_to_servicers, time):
    """Creates a gRPC test server from a dictionary of descriptors to servicers.
    
    Args:
        descriptors_to_servicers: A dictionary mapping service descriptors to 
            their corresponding servicer implementations. This defines which 
            services and methods will be available on the test server.
        time: A time parameter (exact purpose depends on internal implementation,
            typically used for controlling timing-related behavior in tests).
            
    Returns:
        A test server instance configured with the given services and servicers,
        ready for testing gRPC services.
    """
    return _server.server_from_descriptor_to_servicers(
        descriptors_to_servicers, time
    )
```

Key improvements made:
1. Fixed the incomplete license header (added missing "Unless required..." line)
2. Added comprehensive docstring explaining:
   - The function's purpose
   - Parameters with their expected types and purposes
   - Return value description
3. Maintained consistent indentation and formatting
4. Kept the existing implementation unchanged while adding documentation

The comments now provide clear context about:
- What the function does
- What inputs it expects
- What it returns
- Where the actual implementation is delegated to (_server module)

This will help future developers understand and use this function without needing to examine the internal implementation details.
