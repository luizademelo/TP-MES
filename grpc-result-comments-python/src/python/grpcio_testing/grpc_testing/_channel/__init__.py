def testing_channel(descriptors, time):
    """Creates and returns a testing channel for gRPC testing purposes.
    
    Args:
        descriptors: Service descriptors that define the gRPC service methods
                    this channel will handle.
        time: Time component used for controlling channel behavior in tests,
              typically used for simulating time-related operations.
    
    Returns:
        A TestingChannel instance initialized with the given time parameter and
        a fresh channel state. This channel can be used for unit testing gRPC
        services and clients.
    """
    # Create and return a TestingChannel instance with:
    # - The provided time parameter for test control
    # - A fresh channel state object to track channel state during testing
    return _channel.TestingChannel(time, _channel_state.State())
```

The comments include:
1. A clear docstring for the `testing_channel` function explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value
2. A brief explanation of the imports to clarify their purpose
3. An inline comment explaining what happens in the return statement
4. Maintained the original license header (with minor formatting fixes)

The comments provide enough context for future developers to understand:
- What the function does
- What each parameter is for
- What the return value represents
- Where the implementation details come from
- How the channel is initialized
