The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each class and its role in gRPC testing
2. The functionality of each method
3. The flow of data in each RPC pattern (unary-unary, unary-stream, etc.)
4. The purpose of each helper function
5. Key operations like initialization, metadata handling, and termination

The comments are concise yet informative, helping future developers understand the testing infrastructure without needing to dive deep into the implementation details.
