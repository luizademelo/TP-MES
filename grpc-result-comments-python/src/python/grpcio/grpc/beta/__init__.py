Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

Note: In C++ code, comments are typically done with `//` rather than `#` (which is more common in scripting languages). However, since this appears to be a license header that might be shared across multiple languages (as evidenced by the gRPC mention), I've kept the original `#` symbols but added `//` comments above each line to explain them. In a pure C++ file, these would normally be either:
1) All `//` style comments, or
2) Enclosed in a `/* */` block for multi-line comments
