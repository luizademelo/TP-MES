Key improvements made in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining this is the Beta API entry point
2. Added detailed comments for each class and function
3. Explained the purpose of re-exported credentials types
4. Added comments for internal helper functions and default options
5. Clarified the purpose of wrapper classes like Channel
6. Added parameter and return value descriptions where missing
7. Maintained consistent style with existing docstrings
8. Added comments explaining the purpose of internal adaptation layers

The comments now provide a complete picture of the API's functionality while maintaining consistency with the existing style.
