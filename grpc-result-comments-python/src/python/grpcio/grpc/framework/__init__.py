Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I've added comments explaining its purpose:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors, indicating the original copyright holder
# Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// License declaration for Apache License, Version 2.0
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");

```

These comments explain each line of the standard Apache License header, which is important for legal compliance in open source software. The header serves to:
1) Identify the copyright holder
2) Specify the license terms
3) Provide a reference to the full license text
4) Include necessary disclaimers
