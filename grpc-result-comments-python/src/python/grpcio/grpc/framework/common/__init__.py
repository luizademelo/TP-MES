Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
/*

```

The comments provide:
1. A clear description of what this code section represents
2. Explanation of the licensing terms
3. Reference to the full license text
4. Key points about what the license allows and requires
5. Note about warranty disclaimer

This format makes it immediately clear to developers what the legal context is for the code they're working with, while being more readable than just the raw license text.
