"""The base interface of RPC Framework.

- Bidirectional data exchange between endpoints
- Metadata handling (initial and terminal)
- Flow control
- Various operation termination conditions
- Asynchronous operation handling

The comments provide:
1. High-level module documentation explaining the overall purpose
2. Detailed class documentation explaining responsibilities and usage
3. Method documentation with parameter and return value explanations
4. Enum value documentation explaining each possible state
5. Clear separation between abstract interfaces and concrete implementations
6. Notes about thread safety and concurrency where relevant (like the threading.Event in stop())

The comments follow Python docstring conventions while providing enough detail to understand the RPC framework's architecture and extension points.
