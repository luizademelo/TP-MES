Key improvements made in the comments:
1. Added detailed class descriptions explaining their purpose in the RPC framework
2. Added inline comments for each namedtuple field explaining their roles
3. Enhanced docstrings with more context about the purpose and usage of each function
4. Added comments for the constant `_NONE_SUBSCRIPTION`
5. Clarified the relationship between the classes and the base interface
6. Added more specific descriptions of the parameters and return values

The comments now provide a much clearer understanding of:
- What each component represents
- How they fit into the RPC framework
- The purpose of each field and parameter
- The expected usage of the factory functions
