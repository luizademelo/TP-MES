Key improvements made:
1. Added detailed class-level documentation for `_MethodImplementation`
2. Added inline comments explaining the None values in each constructor call
3. Maintained all existing docstrings while making them more consistent
4. Added comments explaining the imports
5. Improved code organization and readability while preserving all functionality
6. Added comments explaining the purpose of each parameter in the namedtuple

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- The purpose of each function
- What each parameter represents
- Which behaviors are being set/ignored in each case
- The overall structure of the method implementation system
