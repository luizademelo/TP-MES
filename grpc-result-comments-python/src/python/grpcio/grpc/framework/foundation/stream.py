The comments now provide:
1. A clearer class-level description explaining the purpose of the Consumer interface
2. More detailed method documentation including:
   - Purpose of each method
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Implementation notes
   - Behavioral expectations
3. Better formatting and structure for readability
4. Clarification about the relationship between methods

The comments maintain the original functionality while making the code's intent and usage clearer for future maintainers.
