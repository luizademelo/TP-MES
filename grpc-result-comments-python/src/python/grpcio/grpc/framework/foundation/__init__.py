Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I've added comments explaining its purpose and significance:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors, indicating the original copyright holders
# Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// License header for Apache License 2.0, a permissive open-source license
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");

// Notice that the code cannot be used without compliance with the license terms
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

// Pointer to where the full license text can be found

// Disclaimer about the software being provided without warranties

// Standard license footer noting it governs permissions and limitations

```

These comments explain:
1. The copyright ownership
2. The specific license being used (Apache 2.0)
3. The requirement for license compliance
4. Where to find the full license text
5. The warranty disclaimer
6. The license's role in governing usage rights

The comments are placed above each line to clearly associate them with the corresponding license text while maintaining the original formatting.
