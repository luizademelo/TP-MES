import time
from typing import Optional

def _timeout_to_deadline(timeout: Optional[float]) -> Optional[float]:
    """Converts a timeout value in seconds to an absolute deadline timestamp.
    
    Args:
        timeout: Optional timeout value in seconds. If None, indicates no timeout.
        
    Returns:
        Optional[float]: The calculated deadline as a timestamp (current time + timeout).
        Returns None if input timeout is None.
        
    Note:
        The deadline is calculated by adding the timeout to the current time
        (as returned by time.time()). This is useful for gRPC operations that
        expect deadlines rather than timeout durations.
    """
    if timeout is None:
        return None
    return time.time() + timeout
```

Key improvements made:
1. Fixed the incomplete license comment (added missing "Unless required by applicable law..." line)
2. Added comprehensive docstring for the `_timeout_to_deadline` function that explains:
   - The function's purpose
   - The input parameter
   - The return value
   - Important notes about the conversion
3. Maintained all existing type hints and imports
4. Kept the original module docstring
5. Formatted the comments to follow standard Python docstring conventions

The comments now clearly explain that this is a utility function for converting timeout durations to absolute deadlines, which is particularly useful for gRPC's asynchronous operations.
