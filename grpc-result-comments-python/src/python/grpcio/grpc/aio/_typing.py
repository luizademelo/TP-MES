from grpc._cython.cygrpc import EOF

from ._metadata import Metadata
from ._metadata import MetadataKey
from ._metadata import MetadataValue

# Generic type variable for request messages
RequestType = TypeVar("RequestType")
# Generic type variable for response messages
ResponseType = TypeVar("ResponseType")
# Type alias for a function that serializes objects to bytes
SerializingFunction = Callable[[Any], bytes]
# Type alias for a function that deserializes bytes to objects
DeserializingFunction = Callable[[bytes], Any]
# Type alias for a single metadata key-value pair
MetadatumType = Tuple[MetadataKey, MetadataValue]
# Type alias for metadata which can be either a Metadata object or sequence of key-value pairs
MetadataType = Union[Metadata, Sequence[MetadatumType]]
# Type alias for channel configuration arguments (sequence of key-value pairs)
ChannelArgumentType = Sequence[Tuple[str, Any]]
# Type alias for EOF marker type
EOFType = type(EOF)
# Type alias for callback function invoked when an operation completes
DoneCallbackType = Callable[[Any], None]
# Type alias for request streams which can be either synchronous or asynchronous iterables
RequestIterableType = Union[Iterable[Any], AsyncIterable[Any]]
# Type alias for response streams which must be asynchronous iterables
ResponseIterableType = AsyncIterable[Any]
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each type alias and generic type variable
2. The structure of complex types like MetadataType and ChannelArgumentType
3. The difference between request and response iterable types
4. The role of serialization/deserialization function types
5. The nature of callback and metadata-related types

The comments are concise yet informative, helping future developers understand the type system used in the gRPC Async API without being overly verbose.
