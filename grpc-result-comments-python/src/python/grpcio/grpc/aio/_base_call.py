I'll provide an enhanced version of the code with additional comments to better explain the functionality and purpose of each component. Here's the commented version:

its information. They also offer methods to manipulate the life-cycle of the
RPC, e.g. cancellation.

Key improvements made in the comments:
1. Added more detailed class-level docstrings explaining the purpose of each abstract base class
2. Enhanced method docstrings with clearer parameter and return value descriptions
3. Added more specific information about possible exceptions
4. Improved consistency in documentation style
5. Added more context about the RPC patterns each class represents
6. Clarified the relationships between classes
7. Added more details about thread-safety considerations
8. Improved type hint documentation

The comments now provide a more complete picture of the API's functionality and usage patterns while maintaining clarity and conciseness.
