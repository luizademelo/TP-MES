Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I've added comments explaining its purpose:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors, indicating the original copyright holder
# Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// License header for Apache License 2.0, specifying the terms under which
// this software can be used, modified, and distributed
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at

```

The comments explain that this is a standard license header block for software distributed under the Apache License 2.0, which is a permissive open-source license. The header includes:
1. Copyright attribution
2. License reference
3. Location of full license text
4. Warranty disclaimer
5. Reference to license terms and limitations
