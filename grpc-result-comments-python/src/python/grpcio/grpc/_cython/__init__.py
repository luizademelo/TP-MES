Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I'll add explanatory comments about its purpose:

```c++
// This is the Apache License 2.0 header that must be included in all
// files distributed as part of the gRPC project.
//
// The license grants permission to use, modify, and distribute the software,
// provided that the license terms are met. It also includes limitations
// of liability and warranties as is standard in open source licenses.
//
// Full license text can be found at:

Note: The original text appears to be incomplete (missing some lines and proper formatting). In a real codebase, you would want to include the complete and properly formatted license header. The comment I've added explains the purpose of this header for developers who might encounter it in the codebase.
