Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added docstring for `_commandfile_spawn` explaining its purpose and parameters
2. Added comments explaining the Windows-specific compiler flag handling
3. Documented the command length calculation and check
4. Explained the temporary file creation and cleanup process
5. Clarified the purpose of the monkey-patching function
6. Added inline comments for important operations like argument escaping and file writing

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- Why this code exists (Windows command line limits)
- What problems it solves
- How it implements the solution
- Important implementation details
