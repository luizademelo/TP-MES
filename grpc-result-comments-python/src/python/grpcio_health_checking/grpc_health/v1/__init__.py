Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I'll add explanatory comments about its purpose:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors, indicating the original copyright holders
# Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// License header for Apache License 2.0, a permissive open-source license
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");

// Notice that the code cannot be used without complying with the license terms
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

// Pointer to where the full license text can be found
# You may obtain a copy of the License at

// URL for the Apache License version 2.0 text
#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

// Disclaimer that the software is provided without warranties
# distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,

// Note about additional license terms and limitations
# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
# limitations under the License.
```

These comments explain:
1. The purpose of each line in the license header
2. The significance of the Apache License 2.0
3. Where to find the full license text
4. The implications of the license terms

The comments are added as C++ style comments (//) while preserving the original Python-style comments (#) of the license header itself.
