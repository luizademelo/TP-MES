Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

# Import the OpenTelemetryPlugin class from the grpc_observability module
# This plugin provides OpenTelemetry integration for gRPC observability
from grpc_observability._open_telemetry_plugin import OpenTelemetryPlugin

# Define the public interface of this module
# Only OpenTelemetryPlugin will be available when using 'from module import *'
__all__ = ("OpenTelemetryPlugin",)
```

I've made the following improvements:
1. Fixed the formatting of the license header (added missing line breaks and the "Unless required..." line)
2. Added comments explaining:
   - The purpose of the OpenTelemetryPlugin import
   - The role of __all__ in defining the module's public interface
3. Maintained consistent comment style with the existing license header
