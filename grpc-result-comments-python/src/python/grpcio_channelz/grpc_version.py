Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

// Version identifier for the gRPC project
// Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[.devN] where N is the development release number
// '1.74.0.dev0' indicates:
// - Major version 1
// - Minor version 74
// - Patch version 0
// - Development release 0 (pre-release version)
VERSION = '1.74.0.dev0'
```

I've added:
1. Comments explaining each section of the legal header
2. A detailed comment about the version number format and what each component means
3. Clear separation between different parts of the documentation
4. Explanation of the development version suffix (.dev0)

The comments maintain the original structure while providing additional context that would be helpful for developers working with or on this codebase.
