Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I'll add explanatory comments about its purpose:

```c++
// This is a standard Apache License 2.0 header that applies to this source file.
// The license governs how this code can be used, modified, and distributed.

# Copyright 2018 The gRPC Authors
// Specifies the copyright holder (The gRPC Authors) and the year of publication

# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
// The code is licensed under Apache License 2.0, a permissive open-source license
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
// Users must comply with the license terms to use this software
# You may obtain a copy of the License at

#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
// The full text of the license can be found at this URL

```

The comments explain:
1. The nature of this block as a license header
2. The purpose of each section of the license text
3. Key points about the Apache 2.0 license terms
4. Where to find the full license text

This helps developers understand why this header exists and what it means for their use of the code, without modifying the actual license text itself.
