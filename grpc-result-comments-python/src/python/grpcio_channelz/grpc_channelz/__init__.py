Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I've added comments explaining its purpose and legal significance:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC project
// This header specifies the copyright ownership and license terms for the code
# Copyright 2018 The gRPC Authors

// Apache License 2.0 - the open-source license governing this software
// Users must comply with the terms of this license when using the software
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at

// Disclaimer about software being provided without warranties

// Note about specific language in the license governing permissions
# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and

```

These comments help developers understand:
1. The nature of this header (copyright and license information)
2. The specific license being used (Apache 2.0)
3. Where to find the full license text
4. Key provisions of the license (no warranty, permission restrictions)

The comments are placed above each relevant section to provide context while maintaining the original formatting required for legal headers.
