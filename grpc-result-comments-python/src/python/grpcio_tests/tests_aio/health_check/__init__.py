Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I'll add explanatory comments about its purpose:

```c++

The comments explain:
1. The copyright information
2. The license being used (Apache 2.0)
3. The requirements for using the code
4. Where to find the full license text
5. The warranty disclaimer
6. The governing terms of use

This header is standard for open-source projects using the Apache License 2.0, particularly in the gRPC ecosystem.
