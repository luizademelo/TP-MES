Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I'll add explanatory comments about its purpose:

```c++
// This is the Apache License 2.0 header that must be included in all files
// distributed as part of this project. It grants permissions and states
// conditions for using, modifying, and distributing the software.

// Copyright notice indicating the original copyright holder (The gRPC Authors)
// and the year of publication (2019)
# Copyright 2019 The gRPC Authors.

// License identifier - Apache License, Version 2.0
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");

// Notice that usage of this file is conditional on compliance with the License
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

// How to obtain a copy of the full license (typically in a LICENSE file)
# You may obtain a copy of the License at

// URL where the license text can be found
#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

// Disclaimer about the software being provided "as is" without warranties
# distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,

// Final section noting that the license contains specific terms and limitations
# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and

```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of this header
2. The meaning of each section
3. Why this legal text is included in the code files
4. How it affects users of the code

This helps developers understand that this isn't functional code but rather required legal documentation that must be preserved when modifying or distributing the software.
