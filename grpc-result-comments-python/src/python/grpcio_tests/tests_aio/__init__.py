# Import absolute_import to ensure Python 2 compatibility by preventing
# relative imports from shadowing standard library modules
from __future__ import absolute_import

# Import test loader and runner modules from the tests package
from tests import _loader
from tests import _runner

# Create public aliases for the imported Loader and Runner classes
# This provides a cleaner public interface for these components
Loader = _loader.Loader
Runner = _runner.Runner
```

Key points about the comments:
1. Fixed the incomplete license comment (added missing "Unless required by applicable law..." line)
2. Added explanation for the `__future__` import
3. Explained the purpose of importing `_loader` and `_runner`
4. Clarified why the aliases (`Loader` and `Runner`) are being created
5. Kept the comments concise while providing useful context
6. Maintained consistent comment style with the existing file
