Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

I've added a comprehensive comment block that:
1. Explains the purpose of this legal header
2. Summarizes the key points of the license
3. Provides context about the Apache License 2.0
4. Notes important considerations for users of the code

The original license text is preserved exactly as it appears, with the comments serving as an explanatory preamble to help developers understand the legal context of the code they're working with.
