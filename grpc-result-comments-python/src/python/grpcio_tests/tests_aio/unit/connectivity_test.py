Key improvements made:
1. Added class-level docstring explaining the test class purpose
2. Added detailed method docstrings for each test case
3. Added inline comments explaining key operations and assertions
4. Clarified the purpose of helper functions and variables
5. Explained the context manager usage differences between tests
6. Documented the expected behavior in each test scenario
7. Added comments about state checking with/without waiting
8. Explained the shutdown test sequence clearly

The comments now provide a clear understanding of what each test is verifying and why certain operations are performed.
