Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the test's purpose
2. Added class docstring explaining its overall responsibility
3. Added detailed method docstrings explaining what each test verifies
4. Added inline comments explaining key operations and their purpose
5. Added comments for the test loop logic and resource cleanup
6. Maintained the existing license header and imports
7. Added explanation for the main block execution

The comments now provide clear context for each component while maintaining readability and following Python docstring conventions.
