Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

// Constant defining an unreachable target path for testing purposes
// This is typically used to simulate or test failure scenarios where a target cannot be reached
UNREACHABLE_TARGET = "foo/bar"

// Time value (in seconds) used to introduce artificial delay in unary call operations
// This is useful for testing timeouts or asynchronous behavior in gRPC calls
UNARY_CALL_WITH_SLEEP_VALUE = 0.2
```

The comments I've added:
1. Added a header comment explaining the copyright and license block
2. Added documentation for UNREACHABLE_TARGET constant explaining its purpose and typical usage
3. Added documentation for UNARY_CALL_WITH_SLEEP_VALUE explaining what it represents and why it might be used

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context for future developers to understand the purpose of these constants.
