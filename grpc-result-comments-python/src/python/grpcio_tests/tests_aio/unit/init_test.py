Key improvements made:
1. Added missing comment line breaks in the license header
2. Added class-level docstring explaining the purpose of the test class
3. Added detailed method docstrings for each test case explaining:
   - What the test verifies
   - The specific functionality being tested
4. Added inline comments explaining key operations
5. Added comments for the main execution block explaining the logging and test runner configuration
6. Maintained consistent style throughout (Google Python style guide)

The comments now provide clear context about the test's purpose and what each part is verifying, which will help future maintainers understand and modify the tests as needed.
