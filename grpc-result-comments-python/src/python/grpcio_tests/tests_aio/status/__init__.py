Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is primarily a license header, I'll add comments explaining its purpose:

```c++
// Copyright notice for the gRPC project
// This specifies the copyright year and owner for legal purposes
# Copyright 2020 The gRPC Authors

// License header for Apache 2.0 License
// This informs users of the legal terms under which they can use this software
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");

// License conditions - users must comply with the license terms
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

// How to obtain a copy of the full license text
# You may obtain a copy of the License at

#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

```

Note: In C++ files, license headers typically use // comments rather than # (which is more common in script files). If this were to be used in a C++ file, it would more conventionally be formatted as:

```c++
// Copyright 2020 The gRPC Authors
//
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
// you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
