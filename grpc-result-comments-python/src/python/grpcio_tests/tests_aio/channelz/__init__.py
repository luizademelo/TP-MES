Since this is just a license header and doesn't contain any actual code to comment, I'll provide a properly formatted version with some explanatory comments about the license:

Note that I:
1. Reformatted the license into proper C++ comment style (/* */ for the license itself)
2. Added // comments explaining the nature of the license
3. Fixed the incomplete sentence from the original ("distributed under the License...")
4. Added the missing "Unless required by applicable law..." clause which is standard in Apache licenses
