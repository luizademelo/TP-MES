Key improvements made:
1. Added complete license header formatting
2. Added docstrings for both functions explaining their purpose
3. Added inline comments explaining key operations
4. Maintained consistent indentation and formatting
5. Added explanation for important imports
6. Clarified the server setup and execution flow

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- The overall purpose of the code (async gRPC benchmark server)
- The server initialization and configuration process
- The execution flow from main() to server startup
- The role of each significant operation
