Key improvements made in the comments:
1. Added docstring for the main `run_worker_server` function explaining its purpose and parameters
2. Added inline comments explaining key operations and configurations
3. Clarified the IPv6 address binding comment to mention IPv4 compatibility
4. Explained the uvloop configuration section
5. Added comments about the overall program flow in the main block
6. Documented the purpose of important imports

The comments maintain a balance between explaining the what and the why, while avoiding over-commenting obvious Python constructs.
