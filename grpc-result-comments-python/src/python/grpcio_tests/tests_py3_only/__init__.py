# Import absolute_import from __future__ to ensure consistent import behavior
# between Python 2 and Python 3 (makes imports absolute by default)
from __future__ import absolute_import

# Import internal test utilities from the tests package
from tests import _loader  # Module containing test loading functionality
from tests import _runner  # Module containing test running functionality

# Create public aliases for the imported test utilities:
# - Loader: Provides functionality for loading test cases
# - Runner: Provides functionality for executing test cases
Loader = _loader.Loader
Runner = _runner.Runner
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright and licensing information
2. The purpose of the `__future__` import
3. The imports of internal test utilities
4. The public aliases being created for those utilities and their general purposes

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context for future maintainers to understand what the code is doing and why these particular imports and aliases exist.
