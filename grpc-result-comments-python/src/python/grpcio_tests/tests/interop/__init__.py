Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I've added comments explaining its purpose:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors, indicating the original copyright holders
# Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// License header for Apache License 2.0, specifying the terms under which
// this software can be used, modified, and distributed
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");

// Notice that users must comply with the license terms to use this software
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

// Pointer to where the full license text can be found
# You may obtain a copy of the License at

// URL for the Apache License 2.0 text
#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

// Disclaimer that the software is provided without warranties
# distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,

// Note about language in the license governing permissions and restrictions
# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and
# limitations under the License.
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright attribution
2. The license being used (Apache 2.0)
3. The requirement for compliance
4. Where to find the full license text
5. The "AS IS" disclaimer
6. The governing terms of the license

These comments help developers understand the legal context of the code they're working with, which is particularly important for open source software.
