Key improvements made:
1. Added detailed docstring for the class explaining its purpose and requirements
2. Added specific docstrings for each test method explaining what RPC pattern it tests
3. Maintained all existing functionality while making the code more self-documenting
4. Clarified that this is a base class meant to be mixed with other test classes
5. Added context about the required stub attribute that needs to be provided by the mixing class

The comments now clearly explain:
- What each test is verifying
- The nature of the RPC pattern being tested
- The class's role in the test infrastructure
- Dependencies and requirements for using the class
