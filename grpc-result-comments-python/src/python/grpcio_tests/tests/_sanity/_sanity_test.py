Key aspects covered in the comments:
1. Class-level constants and their purpose
2. The main test method's overall goal
3. The test discovery and loading process
4. The test suite name extraction logic
5. The platform-specific filtering behavior
6. The test assertions and their purpose
7. The main execution block's functionality

The comments explain both the high-level flow and specific implementation details while maintaining readability. They help future maintainers understand:
- Why certain platform checks exist
- How test discovery works
- What the test is verifying
- Any special handling of test cases
