Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header, I'll add comments explaining its purpose and significance:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors - indicates ownership and year of creation
# Copyright 2016 gRPC authors.

// License declaration - Apache License Version 2.0 is specified
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");

// Disclaimer - software is provided without warranties

```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and its purpose
2. The specific license being used (Apache 2.0)
3. The requirement for compliance
4. Where to find the full license text
5. The warranty disclaimer
6. The legal notices about permissions and limitations

These comments help developers understand the legal context of the code they're working with, which is particularly important for open source projects.
