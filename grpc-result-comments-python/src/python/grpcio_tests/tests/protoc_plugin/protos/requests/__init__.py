Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

Note: I've maintained the original `#` character prefix which is unusual for C++ (typically C++ uses `//` for single-line comments). If this is meant to be actual C++ code, the `#` should likely be replaced with `//`. However, I've preserved the original format since it appears this might be some form of script or special file header.
