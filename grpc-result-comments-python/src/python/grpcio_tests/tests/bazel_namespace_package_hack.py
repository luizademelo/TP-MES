    This function is a workaround for Bazel runtime environments to ensure Python
    can properly process .pth files by adding existing directories from sys.path
    to the site directories list.
    
    The function will:
    1. Check if we're running in a Bazel runtime environment (via env variable)
    2. For each path in sys.path that exists on filesystem:
       - Add it to site directories list using site.addsitedir()
       This allows Python to process any .pth files in these directories
