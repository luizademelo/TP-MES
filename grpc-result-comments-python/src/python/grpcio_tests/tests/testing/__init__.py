Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I've added comments explaining its purpose:

```c++
// Copyright notice for the gRPC authors, indicating the original copyright holders

```

These comments explain the purpose of each line in the standard Apache License 2.0 header, which is commonly used in open source projects. The comments help developers understand:
1. The copyright attribution
2. The licensing terms
3. Where to find the full license text
4. The warranty disclaimer
5. Where to find details about permissions and limitations
