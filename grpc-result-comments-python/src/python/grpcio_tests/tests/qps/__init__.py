Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, the comments explain its purpose and legal implications:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors, indicating the original copyright holders

// portions of the software.

These comments help future developers understand:
1. The purpose of each line in the license header
2. The legal requirements for using the code
3. Where to find the full license text
4. The disclaimer of warranties
5. The governing terms of the license

The comments maintain the original structure while adding explanatory context that would be helpful during software maintenance or legal reviews.
