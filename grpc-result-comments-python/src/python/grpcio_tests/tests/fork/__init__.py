Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, the comments explain the purpose and implications of the license text:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors, indicating the original copyright holders
// This header applies to all files in the gRPC codebase that include it
# Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.

// License declaration for Apache License 2.0, a permissive open-source license

# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

```

Note: In C++ files, license headers typically use // for comments rather than #. The correct version for a C++ file would be:

```c++
