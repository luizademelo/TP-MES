Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the purpose
2. Documented constants and their usage
3. Added detailed class docstring
4. Documented each method's purpose, parameters, and return values
5. Explained the test scenarios and why they're skipped on Windows
6. Added comments about the credential types being used
7. Explained the echo functionality being tested
8. Maintained consistent comment style throughout

The comments now provide clear context about what the code does, why certain decisions were made, and how the different components interact.
