Key improvements made:
1. Added detailed docstrings for each test method explaining their purpose
2. Added inline comments explaining specific operations
3. Added a class-level docstring
4. Fixed formatting in the license header
5. Clarified the purpose of the test cases
6. Added comments about the test assertions
7. Improved the module docstring to be more specific
8. Added comments about the main execution block

The comments now provide clear explanations of:
- What each test is verifying
- The purpose of each operation
- The expected behavior
- The structure of the test cases
- The test setup and assertions
