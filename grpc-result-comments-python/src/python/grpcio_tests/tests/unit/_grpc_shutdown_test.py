Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added explanation for the timeout constant
2. Detailed the test's purpose in the docstring
3. Documented the event variable's purpose
4. Added docstring for the state change callback
5. Explained the channel creation and subscription
6. Clarified the polling loop's purpose
7. Noted the channel close operation
8. Explained the main block's verbosity setting

The comments now provide clear context for each component while maintaining readability.
