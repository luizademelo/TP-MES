Key improvements made:
1. Added docstrings for all functions and class explaining their purpose
2. Added comments for key operations within functions
3. Clarified the purpose of each test case
4. Maintained consistent style with existing license headers
5. Added parameter and behavior explanations where helpful

The comments now provide clear documentation of:
- What each component does
- The expected behavior
- The purpose of each test case
- The flow of operations through the system
