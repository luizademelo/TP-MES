The comments provide:
1. Class-level documentation explaining the purpose of each class
2. Method-level documentation explaining the functionality and parameters
3. Important implementation details about threading and error handling
4. Clear documentation of return values and exceptions
5. Context about how the CompletionQueuePollFuture specializes the SimpleFuture behavior

The comments maintain a consistent style and provide useful information for future maintainers while not being overly verbose.
