Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is a license header rather than functional code, I'll add comments explaining its purpose:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors, indicating the original copyright holders
# Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// License header for Apache License 2.0, specifying the terms under which
// this software can be used, modified, and distributed
# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");

// Notice that users must comply with the license terms to use this software

```

Note: In actual practice, license headers typically don't contain inline comments like this as they are meant to be standardized legal notices. The comments here are provided purely for educational purposes to explain each line's significance. Normally, this header would remain as-is without additional commentary.
