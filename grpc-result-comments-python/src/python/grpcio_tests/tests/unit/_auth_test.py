Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added class-level descriptions explaining the purpose of each test class
2. Added detailed method descriptions explaining what each test verifies
3. Added inline comments explaining key operations and assertions
4. Explained the purpose of the threading.Event usage
5. Clarified the mock implementations and their roles in testing
6. Added comments for the main block execution

The comments follow these principles:
- Explain why code exists, not just what it does
- Highlight important test expectations
- Clarify test synchronization mechanisms
- Document mock behaviors
- Maintain a consistent style throughout
