        - READY: Channel is ready for communication

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the unit tests with increased verbosity to show more detailed output

```

Key improvements made:
1. Added missing "Unless required by applicable law..." line in the license header
2. Added class-level docstring explaining the purpose of the test case
3. Added detailed method-level docstring explaining what the test verifies and listing all connectivity states
4. Added comment explaining the verbosity parameter in the test runner
5. Improved formatting and consistency of the comments
6. Added explanations of what each connectivity state represents in the method docstring

The comments now provide clear context about the purpose of the test and what each part of the code is responsible for, making it easier for future maintainers to understand and modify the code.
