def not_really_secure_channel(
    host, port, channel_credentials, server_host_override
):
    """Creates an insecure Channel to a remote host.
    
    Note: Despite the name suggesting security, this function creates a channel 
    that bypasses SSL hostname verification, making it suitable for testing but 
    not for production use.

    Args:
      host: The name of the remote host to which to connect.
      port: The port of the remote host to which to connect.
      channel_credentials: The implementations.ChannelCredentials with which to
        connect. This should contain SSL credentials despite the insecure nature.
      server_host_override: The target name used for SSL host name checking.
        This overrides the default hostname verification.

    Returns:
      An implementations.Channel to the remote host through which RPCs may be
        conducted. The channel uses SSL but with disabled hostname verification.
    """
    # Construct the target address string in format "host:port"
    target = "%s:%d" % (host, port)
    
    # Create a secure channel with SSL credentials but override hostname verification
    channel = grpc.secure_channel(
        target,
        channel_credentials,
        (

    return implementations.Channel(channel)
```

Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added warning about the insecure nature of the function despite its name
2. Explained the purpose of server_host_override more clearly
3. Added comments for the target string construction
4. Explained the secure_channel options in more detail
5. Clarified the return value's nature
6. Fixed the license header formatting (added missing # on empty lines)
7. Added note about the beta implementations wrapper

The comments now better explain both the intended usage and security implications of this test utility function.
