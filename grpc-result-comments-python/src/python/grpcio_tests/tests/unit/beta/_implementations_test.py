Key improvements made:
1. Added class-level docstrings explaining the purpose of each test class
2. Added detailed method-level docstrings explaining what each test verifies
3. Added inline comments explaining the purpose of key operations
4. Maintained all existing functionality while making the code more understandable
5. Improved the license header formatting for better readability
6. Added explanation of the main block execution

The comments now provide clear context about:
- What each test is verifying
- The purpose of each operation
- The expected behavior of the API being tested
- The flow of the test cases
