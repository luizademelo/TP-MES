Key improvements made:
1. Added a comprehensive docstring for the test method explaining what it tests
2. Added inline comments explaining each test case's purpose
3. Fixed the license header formatting (added missing line breaks)
4. Added comments for the main block execution
5. Organized test cases into logical groups with comments
6. Explained the expected behavior for each test case

The comments now make it clear:
- What functionality is being tested
- Why each test case is important
- What the expected behavior should be
- How to interpret the test results
