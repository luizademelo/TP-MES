Key improvements made:
1. Added class and method docstrings explaining their purpose
2. Added comments for important blocks of code
3. Explained the test scenarios in each test method
4. Added comments for the helper functions
5. Maintained the original code structure while making it more understandable
6. Added comments about the verification steps in each test case
7. Explained the purpose of condition variables and thread synchronization

The comments provide clear explanations while maintaining the original functionality and structure of the code.
