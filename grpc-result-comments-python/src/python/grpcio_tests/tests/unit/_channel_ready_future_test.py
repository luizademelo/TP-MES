Key improvements made:
1. Added class-level docstrings explaining the purpose of each class
2. Added method-level docstrings explaining functionality and verification points
3. Added inline comments for important sections of code
4. Maintained consistent commenting style
5. Explained the test scenarios and what they verify
6. Added comments about the expected behavior in different situations

The comments now provide clear guidance about:
- The purpose of each component
- The expected behavior in different scenarios
- The verification points in each test case
- The flow of execution through the code
