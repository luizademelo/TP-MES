Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is primarily a license header, I've added comments explaining its purpose and significance:

```c++
// Copyright notice for the gRPC project

# Copyright 2023 The gRPC Authors

```

Note: In actual C++ code, these would typically be regular comments (// or /* */) rather than shell-style (#) comments. The # style is more common in scripts or configuration files. If this is meant to be in a C++ file, you might want to convert them to C++ style comments.
