# Import Python's absolute_import feature to ensure proper module imports
# This prevents confusion between local and global module names
from __future__ import absolute_import

# Import internal testing utilities from the tests package
from tests import _loader  # Module containing test loading functionality
from tests import _runner  # Module containing test running functionality

# Create public aliases for the internal loader and runner classes
# This provides a cleaner public interface while keeping implementation details private
Loader = _loader.Loader  # Public interface for test loading functionality
Runner = _runner.Runner  # Public interface for test running functionality
```

Key improvements made:
1. Added missing "Unless required by applicable law..." line in the license header for completeness
2. Added explanation for the `absolute_import` future import
3. Added comments explaining the purpose of importing `_loader` and `_runner`
4. Added comments explaining the rationale behind creating public aliases for the internal classes
5. Maintained consistent comment style and spacing
6. Added specific comments about what each component does

The comments now provide clear context about:
- Why certain imports are used
- The relationship between internal and public interfaces
- The overall purpose of the module (providing test utilities)
