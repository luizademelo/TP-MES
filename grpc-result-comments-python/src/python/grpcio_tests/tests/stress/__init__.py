Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright notice for gRPC authors, indicating the original authors of this code

```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright attribution
2. The licensing terms (Apache 2.0)
3. Where to find the full license text
4. The "AS IS" disclaimer
5. The scope of what the license governs

I've kept the original formatting while adding explanatory comments before each section to make it clear what each part of the license header represents.
