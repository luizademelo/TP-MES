Here's the commented version of the code snippet. Since this is primarily a license header, I'll add explanatory comments about its purpose:

```c++
/*

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header (copyright notice and license information)
2. What the license governs (use, modification, distribution)
3. Where to find full license terms
4. The general conditions of the Apache License 2.0

The original license text is preserved exactly as required by the license terms themselves. The comments are added above the license text to provide additional context without modifying the legally required header.
