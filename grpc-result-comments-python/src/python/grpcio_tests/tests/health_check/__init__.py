Here's the commented version of the provided license header:

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and its purpose
2. The type of license being used
3. The compliance requirement
4. Where to find the full license text
5. The warranty disclaimer
6. The governing language for permissions and limitations

I've kept the original formatting (using # for comments) since this appears to be a script file rather than standard C++ code. The comments are placed above each line to clearly associate them with the corresponding license text.
