# Store the current global symbols before importing grpc_observability
# This will help identify what new symbols are added by the import
_BEFORE_IMPORT = tuple(globals())

# Import all symbols from grpc_observability module
from grpc_observability import *

# Store the global symbols after importing grpc_observability
_AFTER_IMPORT = tuple(globals())

# Create a tuple containing only the elements that were added by the grpc_observability import
# This is done by:
# 1. Comparing the post-import globals with pre-import globals
# 2. Excluding any elements that existed before the import
# 3. Also excluding the '_BEFORE_IMPORT' variable we created for this comparison
GRPC_OBSERVABILITY_ELEMENTS = tuple(
    element
    for element in _AFTER_IMPORT
    if element not in _BEFORE_IMPORT and element != "_BEFORE_IMPORT"
)
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of `_BEFORE_IMPORT` and `_AFTER_IMPORT` in tracking global symbols
2. The wildcard import from grpc_observability
3. The logic behind `GRPC_OBSERVABILITY_ELEMENTS` which identifies newly imported symbols
4. The filtering conditions used in the tuple comprehension

This documentation helps future developers understand:
- Why we're capturing globals before and after import
- What the final tuple represents
- How we're distinguishing between pre-existing and newly imported symbols
