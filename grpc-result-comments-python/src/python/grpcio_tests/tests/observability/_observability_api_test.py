Key improvements made:
1. Added class-level docstring explaining the purpose of the test class
2. Added detailed method docstrings explaining what each test verifies
3. Added comments explaining the purpose of imports
4. Added comments explaining the test assertions
5. Added comment about the main block configuration
6. Maintained all existing functionality while making the code more understandable

The comments now clearly explain:
- The purpose of each test
- What is being verified
- The expected behavior
- The structure of the test suite
- The test execution configuration
