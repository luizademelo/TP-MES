Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

# Store the current global symbols before importing the module
# This helps track what new symbols are added by the import
_BEFORE_IMPORT = tuple(globals())

# Import all symbols from the grpc_csm_observability module
# This makes all public symbols from the module available in current namespace
from grpc_csm_observability import *

# Store the global symbols after the import
# This will include both original symbols and newly imported ones
_AFTER_IMPORT = tuple(globals())

# Create a tuple of elements that were added by the import:
# 1. Compares before and after import states
# 2. Excludes the _BEFORE_IMPORT tracking variable itself
# 3. Contains only elements that were added by the import
GRPC_CSM_OBSERVABILITY_ELEMENTS = tuple(
    element
    for element in _AFTER_IMPORT
    if element not in _BEFORE_IMPORT and element != "_BEFORE_IMPORT"
)
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of tracking globals before and after import
2. The wildcard import statement
3. The logic behind identifying newly imported symbols
4. The filtering of the tracking variable itself from the result
5. The overall purpose of the code (to track and expose what was imported)

The code appears to be part of a module that wants to explicitly track and potentially expose what symbols were imported from grpc_csm_observability.
