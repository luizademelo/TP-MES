Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each line in the standard copyright header
2. The legal implications of each statement
3. Where to find additional information (the license URL)
4. The boilerplate nature of these declarations

This documentation helps future developers understand the legal context of the code they're working with, even if they're not familiar with standard open-source license headers.
