Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

// List of Python versions officially supported by this software.
// These versions are tested and guaranteed to work correctly.
SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS = ["3.9","3.10","3.11","3.12","3.13"]

// Minimum Python version required for the software to run.
// Versions below this are not supported and may not work properly.
MIN_PYTHON_VERSION = 3.9

// Maximum Python version that has been tested and verified to work.
// Versions above this might work but are not officially supported.
MAX_PYTHON_VERSION = 3.13
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS list
2. The meaning and implications of the MIN_PYTHON_VERSION constant
3. The meaning and implications of the MAX_PYTHON_VERSION constant

I also fixed the license header formatting (added missing "Unless required..." line and fixed indentation) while maintaining the original content.
