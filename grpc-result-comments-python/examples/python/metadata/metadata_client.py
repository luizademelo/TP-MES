Key improvements made:
1. Added a docstring for the `run()` function explaining its purpose
2. Added comments explaining the gRPC channel creation
3. Added comments about the stub creation
4. Added detailed comments about the RPC call and metadata handling
5. Explained the response processing and trailing metadata
6. Clarified the main block's purpose

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- The overall client architecture
- How metadata is sent and received
- The purpose of each code section
- Important implementation details about binary vs text metadata
