```

Key improvements made:
1. Added missing comment headers for the license blocks
2. Added docstring for the main `run()` function
3. Added detailed comments explaining:
   - The channel creation
   - The stub creation
   - Both approaches to handling streaming responses (async generator and manual read)
   - The purpose of each code block
4. Maintained the existing functionality while making it more understandable
5. Added explanation of the main block execution

The comments now provide clear explanations of both the high-level purpose and the detailed implementation of each component.
