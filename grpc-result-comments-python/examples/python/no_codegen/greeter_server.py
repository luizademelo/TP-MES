Key improvements made:
1. Added comprehensive docstrings for classes and methods
2. Added comments explaining key operations and parameters
3. Fixed the incomplete license header (added missing "Unless required by applicable law" line)
4. Added comments for module imports
5. Explained the server configuration and startup process
6. Documented the RPC method implementation details

The comments now provide clear explanations of:
- The overall purpose of each component
- What each method does
- The parameters and return values
- The server configuration details
- The flow of execution
