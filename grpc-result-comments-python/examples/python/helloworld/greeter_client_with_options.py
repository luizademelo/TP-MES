Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level comments explaining the overall purpose
2. Documented the run() function's purpose and flow
3. Explained the channel options in detail
4. Clarified the RPC call parameters
5. Added comments for the main block execution
6. Maintained all existing license headers and docstrings

The comments provide clear explanations while maintaining readability and following Python conventions.
