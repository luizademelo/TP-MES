Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added explanation for the channel options
2. Documented the purpose of the `run()` coroutine
3. Explained the channel creation and stub initialization
4. Clarified the RPC call parameters and timeout
5. Added comments for the main block execution
6. Maintained the existing docstring which provides good high-level context

The comments are focused on explaining the why and how of the code's functionality while avoiding redundancy with the code itself.
