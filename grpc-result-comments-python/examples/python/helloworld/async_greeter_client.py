Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added a docstring for the `run()` function explaining its overall purpose
2. Added comments for each major operation (channel creation, stub creation, RPC call)
3. Explained the use of `async with` for resource management
4. Clarified the purpose of `logging.basicConfig()`
5. Explained the use of `asyncio.run()` to execute the async function
6. Maintained all existing license and header information

The comments are concise yet informative, helping future developers understand both the high-level flow and specific implementation details.
