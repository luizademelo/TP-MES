Key improvements made:
1. Added missing line in the license header
2. Added detailed docstring for the `run()` function explaining its purpose and behavior
3. Added comments explaining each significant operation
4. Clarified the purpose of each import
5. Added explanation about the context manager (`with` statement) usage
6. Made the code structure clearer with spacing between logical sections
7. Added comment about the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- What the code does
- How the gRPC client works
- The flow of execution
- Important implementation details
