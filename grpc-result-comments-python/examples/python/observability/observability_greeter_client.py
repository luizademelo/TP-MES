Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level comments explaining the purpose of each import
2. Documented the constant `OTEL_EXPORT_INTERVAL_S`
3. Added comprehensive docstring for the `run()` function
4. Added inline comments explaining each significant operation
5. Clarified the purpose of each section (metrics setup, gRPC call, cleanup)
6. Explained the insecure channel usage (noting it's for demo purposes)
7. Documented the error handling and metrics display sections

The comments maintain a balance between explaining the what and the why, helping future developers understand both the implementation and the intent behind the code.
