Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the purpose
2. Added comments for all significant imports
3. Documented the `process()` function with its purpose and parameters
4. Added detailed comments for the error handling logic
5. Documented the `main()` function
6. Added comments for the channel creation and stub initialization
7. Explained the purpose of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- The overall flow of the program
- The error handling strategy
- The purpose of each significant code block
- The role of each imported module
- The structure of the gRPC communication
