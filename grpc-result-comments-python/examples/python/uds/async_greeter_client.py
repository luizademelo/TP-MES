Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added docstring for the `run()` function explaining its purpose and behavior
2. Added comments explaining each significant operation
3. Clarified the purpose of the UDS address formats
4. Explained the use of async context manager for the channel
5. Documented the stub creation and RPC call
6. Added explanation for the logging configuration
7. Noted the use of asyncio.run() for executing the async function

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- What the code does (UDS client for gRPC)
- How it does it (connection attempts, RPC call)
- Why certain choices were made (insecure channel, two address formats)
- The overall flow of the program
