Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module import purpose explanations
2. Documented the `run()` function's overall purpose
3. Explained the UDS address formats being tested
4. Added comments for each major operation (channel creation, stub creation, RPC call)
5. Explained the logging configuration
6. Added context for the main execution block
7. Maintained all original functionality while making the code more understandable

The comments follow best practices by:
- Explaining why certain things are done, not just what is done
- Being concise but informative
- Using proper docstring format for the function
- Including type information where helpful
- Maintaining a consistent style throughout
