Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added class-level docstring for the Greeter service
2. Added detailed method docstring for SayHello including args and return value
3. Added explanation for the `del request` line
4. Added comprehensive function docstring for `serve()`
5. Added inline comments explaining key operations in the serve function
6. Added comment for the main block execution
7. Maintained all existing license and file docstring information

The comments now provide clear explanations of the code's purpose and functionality while maintaining good readability.
