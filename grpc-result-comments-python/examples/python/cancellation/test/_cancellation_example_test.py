Key improvements made:
1. Added comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
2. Added inline comments explaining key operations
3. Documented parameters and return values
4. Explained the purpose of each test case
5. Added comments about cleanup operations
6. Maintained all existing functionality while making it more understandable
7. Added comments about the context manager behavior
8. Documented the purpose of the signal handling test

The comments now provide a clear understanding of what each part of the code does and why, making it much easier for future developers to maintain and modify the code.
