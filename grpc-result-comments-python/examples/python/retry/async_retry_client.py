Key additions in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the purpose
2. Documented the run() function's purpose
3. Explained the retry policy configuration in detail
4. Added comments for each channel option
5. Documented the channel creation and stub usage
6. Explained the RPC call and response handling
7. Added comments for the main execution block

The comments now provide clear explanations of:
- The retry mechanism configuration
- The gRPC channel setup
- The asynchronous execution flow
- The purpose of each significant code block
