    This function reads a JSON file containing geographic features and converts
    each entry into a Feature protocol buffer object. The JSON file is expected
    to contain an array of objects with 'name' and 'location' fields, where
    location contains 'latitude' and 'longitude' values.

Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added detailed docstring explaining the function's purpose and expected JSON structure
2. Added inline comments explaining each step of the process
3. Clarified the return value type and content
4. Maintained consistent comment style and spacing
5. Added missing "Unless required by applicable law" line in the license header
6. Explained the protobuf object creation process

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- What the function does
- How it processes the data
- What the expected input format is
- What the output will contain
- The purpose of each significant code block
