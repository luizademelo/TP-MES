Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the purpose
2. Added comments for all major components (AuthGateway class, channel creation, RPC sending)
3. Documented all function parameters and return values
4. Added explanation of the authentication mechanism
5. Clarified the flow of the program in the main function
6. Added comments about important implementation details (like the lower-case metadata requirement)

The comments are concise but informative, helping future developers understand both what the code does and why certain implementation choices were made.
