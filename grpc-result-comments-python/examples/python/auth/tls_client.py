Key improvements made:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the purpose
2. Added comments for all major imports and constants
3. Added detailed docstring for the `send_rpc` function
4. Added inline comments explaining key operations
5. Added docstring for the `main` function
6. Added explanation for the if-main block
7. Maintained consistent comment style throughout

The comments now provide clear explanations of:
- What each component does
- The flow of the program
- Error handling
- Security aspects (TLS/SSL)
- Logging behavior
- Protocol buffer usage
