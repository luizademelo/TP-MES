Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the purpose
2. Documented all major components (constants, class, methods)
3. Added detailed parameter and return value descriptions for the RPC method
4. Included high-level overview of the server setup process in the serve() function
5. Added explanatory comments for key operations
6. Maintained consistent style throughout

The comments now provide clear guidance for future developers while not being overly verbose. They explain both what the code does and why certain decisions were made.
