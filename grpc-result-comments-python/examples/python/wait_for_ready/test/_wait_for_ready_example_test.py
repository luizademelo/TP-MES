Key improvements made:
1. Added class-level docstring explaining the purpose of the test case
2. Added detailed docstrings for each test method explaining:
   - What functionality is being tested
   - How the test works (synchronous vs asynchronous)
3. Added comments for the main execution block explaining:
   - The logging configuration
   - The purpose of increased verbosity in test output

The comments now provide clear context about the test's purpose and implementation details while maintaining readability.
