"""An example of setting a server connection timeout independent from the
overall RPC timeout.

For stream server, if client set wait_for_ready but server never actually starts,
client will wait indefinitely, this example will do the following steps to set a
timeout on client side:
1. Set server to return initial_metadata once it receives request.
2. Client will set a timer (customized client timeout) waiting for initial_metadata.
3. Client will timeout if it didn't receive initial_metadata.

Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the purpose
2. Added function-level docstrings explaining purpose, parameters and behavior
3. Added inline comments for important operations
4. Maintained existing license header and original docstring
5. Explained the threading and async operations
6. Clarified the timeout handling logic
7. Documented the gRPC-specific operations

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- The overall purpose (handling client-side connection timeouts)
- The flow of execution
- The role of each component
- The error handling cases
- The threading model being used
