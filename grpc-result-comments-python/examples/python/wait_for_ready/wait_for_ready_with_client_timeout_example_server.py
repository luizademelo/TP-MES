"""An example of setting a server connection timeout independent from the
overall RPC timeout.

For stream server, if client set wait_for_ready but server never actually starts,
client will wait indefinitely, this example will do the following steps to set a
timeout on client side:
1. Set server to return initial_metadata once it receives request.
2. Client will set a timer (customized client timeout) waiting for initial_metadata.
3. Client will timeout if it didn't receive initial_metadata.

Key improvements made:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the purpose of the example
2. Added docstrings for all functions and classes
3. Added comments explaining key sections of the code
4. Documented the purpose of constants
5. Added parameter and return value descriptions for the RPC method
6. Explained the server setup and execution flow
7. Maintained all existing functionality while making it more understandable

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- The overall purpose of the example (connection timeout handling)
- The flow of execution
- What each component does
- The RPC method's behavior
- The server configuration and lifecycle
