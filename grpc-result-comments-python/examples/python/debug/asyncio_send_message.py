Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the overall purpose
2. Added function docstrings explaining purpose, parameters, and behavior
3. Added inline comments for important operations and error handling
4. Clarified the asynchronous nature of the operations
5. Explained the gRPC-specific components (stubs, channels, requests)
6. Documented the command-line argument handling
7. Noted the insecure channel usage (no TLS)

The comments follow Python docstring conventions and provide both high-level overview and specific implementation details where needed.
