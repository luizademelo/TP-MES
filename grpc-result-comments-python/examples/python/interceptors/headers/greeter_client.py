Key improvements made:
1. Added missing "Unless required by applicable law..." line in license header
2. Added detailed docstring for the `run()` function
3. Added comments explaining each significant operation
4. Added notes about security considerations (insecure channel)
5. Clarified the purpose of the header interceptor
6. Added comments about the generated protobuf classes
7. Explained the basic program flow

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- What the code does
- Why certain operations are performed
- Important considerations
- The overall flow of the gRPC client
