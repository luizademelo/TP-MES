Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added class-level docstring explaining the purpose of the interceptor
2. Added detailed docstrings for each method explaining:
   - What the method does
   - Arguments (with types/descriptions)
   - Return values
3. Added docstring for the `create` factory function
4. Maintained consistent formatting and style
5. Added explanation of the interceptor function signature in `__init__`
6. Clarified the purpose of each interception method (unary vs stream variants)

The comments now provide comprehensive documentation for anyone who needs to use or maintain this interceptor class.
