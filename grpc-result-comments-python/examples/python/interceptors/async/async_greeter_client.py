Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the purpose
2. Documented the context variable's purpose
3. Added detailed function docstring for `run()`
4. Explained each significant operation within the `run()` function
5. Clarified the purpose of the RPC ID generation
6. Documented the main block's functionality
7. Maintained a consistent comment style throughout

The comments now provide clear explanations of both the high-level purpose and the implementation details of each component.
