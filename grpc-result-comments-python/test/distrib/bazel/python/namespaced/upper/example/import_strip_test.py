Key improvements made:
1. Added comprehensive class-level docstring explaining the purpose of the test case
2. Added detailed method-level docstrings for each test case
3. Added inline comments explaining key operations
4. Fixed the license header formatting (added missing # for comment lines)
5. Added comments for the main execution block
6. Improved overall readability while maintaining all original functionality

The comments now clearly explain:
- What each test is verifying
- The purpose of each code block
- The expected behavior
- The structure of the test file
