"""A trivial executable that imports Protobuf generated code where the
proto_library and py_proto_library are in different Bazel packages.

This script demonstrates importing Protocol Buffer generated Python code
in a scenario where the proto definitions and their Python bindings are
defined in separate Bazel packages. This is a common pattern in larger
codebases where proto definitions and language-specific bindings are
maintained separately.
"""

# Import the Protocol Buffer generated Python code from a subpackage.
# The module 'subpackage_pb2' contains the Python classes generated from
# the .proto file definitions. This import works even though the proto_library
# and py_proto_library targets are in different Bazel packages, demonstrating
# proper package structure and dependency management.
