Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++

```

Note: In C++ code, you would typically use `//` for comments rather than `#` (which is more common in scripting languages). The original appears to be using `#` possibly because it's a header/special file (like a LICENSE file) rather than standard C++ code. If this is meant to be actual C++ code, the `#` should be replaced with `//`.
