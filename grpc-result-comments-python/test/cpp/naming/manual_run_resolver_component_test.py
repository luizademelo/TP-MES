Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added explanation for each import statement
2. Documented the purpose of environment variable usage
3. Explained the directory change operation
4. Added description for the DNS server port constant
5. Added detailed comments for each parameter in the subprocess call
6. Maintained the original license header
7. Used clear, concise language while ensuring technical accuracy

The comments now provide a clear understanding of what each part of the code does, making it easier for future developers to maintain and modify this script.
