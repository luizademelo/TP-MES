Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added module-level docstring explaining the script's purpose
2. Added function docstrings for `main()`, `OnResolverResultAvailable()`, and `BeginQuery()`
3. Added comments explaining the command line arguments
4. Added comments explaining the callback mechanism and asynchronous operations
5. Added parameter and return value documentation
6. Maintained all existing license and copyright information

The comments now provide a clear understanding of:
- The overall script functionality
- How command line arguments are processed
- The asynchronous DNS query flow
- The result processing callback
- The Twisted reactor pattern being used
