The comments added include:
1. A file-level comment explaining the purpose of the header file
2. A detailed comment explaining the version macro, including:
   - Its purpose
   - The version format (semantic versioning)
   - The meaning of the 'dev' suffix
   - Maintenance guidance about when to update it

The existing license header has been preserved unchanged. The #ifndef header guard remains functional as is, with just an added comment to mark its closing.
