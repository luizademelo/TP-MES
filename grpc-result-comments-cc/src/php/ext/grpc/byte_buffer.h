zend_string* byte_buffer_to_zend_string(grpc_byte_buffer *buffer);

#endif /* NET_GRPC_PHP_GRPC_BYTE_BUFFER_H_ */
```

Key improvements made:
1. Added detailed function documentation using doxygen-style comments
2. Documented parameters and return values for both functions
3. Added a closing comment for the #endif directive to show what it's closing
4. Maintained all existing copyright and license information
5. Kept the original structure and organization of the header file

The comments now clearly explain:
- What each function does
- The purpose of each parameter
- The return type and what it represents
- The relationship between C strings, gRPC byte buffers, and PHP strings
