// Import the UIKit framework which provides the core infrastructure
// for iOS applications, including the UIViewController class
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

// Declaration of ViewController interface which inherits from UIViewController
// This serves as the base class for the main view controller of the iOS app
@interface ViewController : UIViewController
// No additional methods or properties are declared in this header file
// Implementation would be in the corresponding .m file
@end
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright and licensing information at the top
2. The purpose of the UIKit import
3. The ViewController interface declaration and its relationship to UIViewController
4. Notes about where the implementation would be found and that this is a basic declaration without additional methods or properties
