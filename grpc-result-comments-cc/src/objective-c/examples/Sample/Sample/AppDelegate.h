// Import UIKit framework which provides essential infrastructure for iOS apps
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

// AppDelegate interface declaration
// The AppDelegate is the root object of the application and handles important
// system events like app launch, transitions between states, and notifications.
@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate>

// The main window of the application
// This property holds a strong reference to the UIWindow instance that
// represents the application's main window. The window is responsible for
// displaying the app's content on the device screen.
@property(strong, nonatomic) UIWindow* window;

@end
```

Key points about the comments:
1. Added explanation about the UIKit import
2. Explained the purpose of the AppDelegate class
3. Documented the window property's role and memory management (strong reference)
4. Maintained the original license header
5. Kept the comments concise while being informative

The comments now provide context about the class's role in the iOS application lifecycle and the purpose of its main property.
