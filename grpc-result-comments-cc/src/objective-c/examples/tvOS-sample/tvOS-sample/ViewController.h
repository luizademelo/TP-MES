// Import UIKit framework which provides fundamental iOS UI classes and infrastructure
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

/**
 * ViewController interface declaration.
 * This serves as the main view controller class for the iOS application.
 * It inherits from UIViewController, the base class for view controllers in UIKit.
 * 
 * Note: Currently this is just a declaration with no additional methods or properties.
 * In a typical implementation, this would contain:
 * - IBOutlet properties for UI elements
 * - IBAction methods for user interactions
 * - Custom methods for view lifecycle events
 * - Application-specific logic methods
 */
@interface ViewController : UIViewController

@end
```

The comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of the UIKit import
2. Added comprehensive documentation for the ViewController interface:
   - Explained its role as the main view controller
   - Mentioned its inheritance from UIViewController
   - Noted the current minimal implementation
   - Provided information about what would typically be included in a view controller
   - Used /** */ style for interface documentation which is standard for Objective-C header documentation

The original license header was preserved without modification.
