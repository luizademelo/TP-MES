// Import the UIKit framework which provides required classes and protocols
// for iOS application development
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

// AppDelegate interface declaration
// The AppDelegate is the entry point of the iOS application and handles
// application lifecycle events by conforming to the UIApplicationDelegate protocol
@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate>

// Strong reference to the application's main window
// This property holds the UIWindow instance that serves as the container for
// the app's visible content. The window property is marked as strong to maintain
// its reference throughout the application's lifecycle.
@property(strong, nonatomic) UIWindow* window;

@end
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the UIKit import
2. The role of the AppDelegate class
3. The significance of the UIApplicationDelegate protocol conformance
4. The purpose and memory management semantics of the window property

The comments are concise yet informative, providing context about the code's purpose and implementation details that would be helpful for future maintenance.
