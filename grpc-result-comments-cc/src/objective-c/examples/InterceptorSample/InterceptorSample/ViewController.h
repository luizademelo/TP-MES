// Importing UIKit framework which provides required infrastructure for iOS apps
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

/**
 * ViewController interface declaration.
 * This serves as the main view controller for the iOS application.
 * Inherits from UIViewController, the base class for view controllers in UIKit.
 * Currently empty (no additional properties or methods declared).
 */
@interface ViewController : UIViewController

@end
```

The comments added:
1. Added a comment explaining the UIKit import
2. Added comprehensive documentation for the ViewController interface:
   - Explained its purpose as the main view controller
   - Mentioned its inheritance from UIViewController
   - Noted that it's currently empty (no custom properties/methods)
