 * InterfaceController class declaration.
 * 
 * This serves as the main interface controller for a WatchOS application.
 * It inherits from WKInterfaceController, which is the base class for all 
 * interface controllers in WatchKit apps.
 * 
 * Interface controllers manage the user interface and respond to user interactions
 * on the Apple Watch. Each screen in a WatchOS app typically has its own
 * interface controller.

// Note: The implementation of this interface would be in a corresponding .m file
// where actual functionality would be implemented.

Key additions in the comments:
1. Added a summary comment for the copyright block
2. Added comments explaining each import statement
3. Added comprehensive documentation for the InterfaceController class:
   - Its purpose in the WatchOS app architecture
   - Inheritance relationship
   - Typical usage patterns
4. Added a note about where the implementation would be found

The comments provide context about both the technical aspects (frameworks used, inheritance) and the architectural role this class plays in a WatchOS application.
