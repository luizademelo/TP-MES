// Import UIKit framework which provides fundamental iOS UI components and infrastructure
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

/**
 * ViewController interface declaration.
 * This serves as the main view controller class for the iOS application.
 * Inherits from UIViewController, the base class for view controllers in UIKit.
 * Currently declared as an empty interface, awaiting implementation of 
 * view lifecycle methods and other controller logic.
 */
@interface ViewController : UIViewController

@end
```

The comments added:
1. Added a brief explanation of the UIKit import
2. Added comprehensive documentation for the ViewController interface:
   - Explained its purpose
   - Mentioned its inheritance
   - Noted its current state (empty interface)
   - Indicated what would typically be implemented here
