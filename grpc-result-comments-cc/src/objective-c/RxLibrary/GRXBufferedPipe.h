/**
 * GRXBufferedPipe is a concrete implementation of GRXWriter that also conforms to GRXWriteable.
 * It provides buffered pipe functionality, allowing data to be written to it (as a GRXWriteable)
 * and read from it (as a GRXWriter).
 *
 * This class is typically used to create a communication channel between parts of a system,
 * where one component writes data and another component reads it.
 */
@interface GRXBufferedPipe : GRXWriter <GRXWriteable>

/**
 * Creates and returns a new instance of GRXBufferedPipe.
 *
 * @return An autoreleased instance of GRXBufferedPipe.
 * @note This is the designated factory method for creating buffered pipe instances.

```

The comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of the Foundation import
2. Added a detailed class-level comment explaining GRXBufferedPipe's role and functionality
3. Added documentation for the `pipe` factory method including return value and note about it being the designated factory method

The comments follow Objective-C conventions and provide clear explanations of the class's purpose and its main method while maintaining the original copyright and licensing information.
