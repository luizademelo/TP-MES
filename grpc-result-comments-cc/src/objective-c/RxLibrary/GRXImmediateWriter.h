The comments added:
1. Added a class-level description explaining the purpose of GRXImmediateWriter
2. Added detailed documentation for each factory method, including:
   - The purpose of each method
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return value description
   - Behavior explanation
3. Maintained consistent formatting and style throughout
4. Used clear, concise language while being thorough in explanations

The comments follow standard Objective-C documentation conventions and provide enough information for future developers to understand how to use each method without needing to examine the implementation.
