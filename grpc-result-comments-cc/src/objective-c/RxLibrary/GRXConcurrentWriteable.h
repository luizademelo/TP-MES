Key points about the comments:
1. Added a class-level description explaining the purpose of GRXConcurrentWriteable
2. Documented each method with:
   - Purpose/functionality
   - Parameters (with @param tags)
   - Return values (where applicable)
3. Noted the thread-safety aspect of the class
4. Distinguished between the designated and convenience initializers
5. Explained the asynchronous nature of the operations
6. Maintained consistent formatting and style with the original code

The comments provide clear guidance for future developers about how to use and maintain this class while preserving all the original licensing information.
