Key additions in the comments:
1. Added explanation of the class purpose and inheritance
2. Added documentation for the class method including parameter and return value descriptions
3. Added note about the framework context (gRPC)
4. Maintained all original copyright and licensing information
5. Added brief comments for the imports to explain their purpose

The comments follow Objective-C documentation conventions and provide clear context for future maintainers about:
- What the class does
- How it relates to its parent class
- The purpose of its method
- Parameter and return value expectations
