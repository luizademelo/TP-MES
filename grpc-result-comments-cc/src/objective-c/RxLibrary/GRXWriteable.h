The comments provide:
1. Explanation of the protocol's purpose and methods
2. Documentation for each block type definition
3. Description of the interface and its factory methods
4. Parameter explanations for all methods
5. Return value documentation
6. Notes about the designated initializer

The comments follow Objective-C conventions and provide enough detail for future maintainers to understand the purpose and usage of each component without being overly verbose.
