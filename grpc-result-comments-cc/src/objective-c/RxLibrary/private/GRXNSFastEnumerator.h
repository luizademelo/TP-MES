The comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of the Foundation import
2. Added a class-level comment explaining GRXNSFastEnumerator's role
3. Documented the initializer method with parameter and return value descriptions
4. Used appropriate comment styles (/// for single-line, /** */ for multi-line documentation)
5. Maintained all existing copyright and license information

The comments now provide clear context about the class's purpose and usage while preserving all original legal information.
