/**
 * GRXNSScalarEnumerator is a custom NSEnumerator subclass that enumerates over a single scalar value.
 * This is useful for cases where you need to treat a single value as a sequence of one element,

@interface GRXNSScalarEnumerator : NSEnumerator

/**
 * Initializes the enumerator with a single value to be enumerated.
 *
 * @param value The single value that this enumerator will return when enumerated.
 *              The value is retained (if it's an object) for the lifetime of the enumerator.

```

Key additions:
1. Added a description of the class purpose and behavior
2. Documented the initialization method including parameter and return value
3. Added note about memory management (retention) of the value
4. Kept all original copyright and licensing information intact

The comments follow Objective-C documentation conventions and provide clear information about:
- Why this class exists
- How to use it
- What to expect from its behavior
- Memory management implications
