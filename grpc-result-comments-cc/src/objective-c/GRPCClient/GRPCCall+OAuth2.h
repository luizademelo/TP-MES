// Importing the base GRPCCallLegacy header file
#import "GRPCCallLegacy.h"

// Forward declaration of GRPCAuthorizationProtocol
@protocol GRPCAuthorizationProtocol;

// OAuth2 extension for GRPCCall class
@interface GRPCCall (OAuth2)

// OAuth2 access token used for authentication
// Atomic property ensures thread-safe access
@property(atomic, copy) NSString* oauth2AccessToken;

// Readonly property containing the OAuth2 challenge header
// Atomic property ensures thread-safe access
@property(atomic, copy, readonly) NSString* oauth2ChallengeHeader;

// Token provider that conforms to GRPCAuthorizationProtocol
// Used to dynamically provide authorization tokens
// Atomic property ensures thread-safe access
@property(atomic, strong) id<GRPCAuthorizationProtocol> tokenProvider;

@end
```

The comments added explain:
1. The purpose of the file import
2. The forward protocol declaration
3. The category/extension being defined (OAuth2 functionality for GRPCCall)
4. Each property's purpose and why atomic is used (thread safety)
5. The readonly nature of the challenge header property
6. The role of the token provider property

The comments maintain the original license header and provide clear explanations of the code's functionality while being concise and helpful for future maintainers.
