// This header is only included when GRPC_TEST_OBJC is defined,
// indicating it's for Objective-C testing purposes.
#ifdef GRPC_TEST_OBJC

// Import the GRPCCall header from the parent directory
#import "../GRPCCall.h"

// Category extension for GRPCCall that exposes internal methods for testing
@interface GRPCCall (InternalTests)

// Enables or disables logging of operation batches
// @param enabled Boolean flag to turn logging on/off
+ (void)enableOpBatchLog:(BOOL)enabled;

// Retrieves the current operation batch log and clears it
// @return NSArray containing the logged operation batches
+ (NSArray *)obtainAndCleanOpBatchLog;

@end

#endif  // GRPC_TEST_OBJC

```

The comments explain:
1. The conditional compilation block and its purpose
2. The header import statement
3. The purpose of the InternalTests category
4. Each method's functionality and parameters
5. The closing of the conditional compilation block

The comments maintain the original license header while adding clear explanations of the code's purpose and functionality, particularly focusing on the testing-specific aspects of this interface.
