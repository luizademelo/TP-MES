The comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of the file import
2. Added documentation for the category extension
3. Added detailed documentation for each method including:
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Nullability annotations
   - Return value explanation
   - Purpose of each method
4. Maintained the existing license header without modification
5. Used consistent formatting for documentation comments

The comments follow standard Objective-C documentation style and provide clear information about the interface's purpose and usage.
