Key improvements made:
1. Added class-level documentation for GRPCResponseHandler, GRPCRequestOptions, and GRPCCall2
2. Added detailed method documentation for all public methods
3. Documented all properties with their purposes
4. Added parameter documentation for methods that take parameters
5. Clarified the purpose of optional protocol methods
6. Added notes about designated initializers and unavailable methods
7. Maintained consistent documentation style throughout

The comments now provide clear guidance for developers about:
- The purpose of each class and protocol
- How to use each method
- What parameters are expected
- What each property represents
- The overall flow of the gRPC call lifecycle
