Key additions:
1. Added explanation of the NS_ASSUME_NONNULL macros
2. Documented the GRPCCoreTransportFactory protocol and its purpose
3. Added detailed documentation for the createCoreChannelFactoryWithCallOptions method
4. Added class-level comments explaining the purpose of both factory implementations
5. Maintained all original code structure while adding explanatory comments

The comments now provide clear context about:
- The purpose of each component
- The relationship between the protocols and classes
- The difference between secure and insecure factories
- Method parameters and return values
