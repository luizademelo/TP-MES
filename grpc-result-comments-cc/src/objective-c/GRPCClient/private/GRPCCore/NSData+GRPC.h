The comments added include:

1. A brief explanation of the Foundation framework import
2. A note about the forward declaration
3. Documentation for the category itself
4. Detailed method documentation for both methods including:
   - Brief description of purpose
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return value descriptions
   - Important notes about memory management responsibilities

The comments follow standard Objective-C documentation conventions and provide clear information about the interface's purpose and usage while maintaining the original license header.
