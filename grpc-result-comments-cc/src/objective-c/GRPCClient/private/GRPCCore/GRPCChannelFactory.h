Key additions:
1. Added explanation of the file's purpose and license header
2. Documented the NS_ASSUME_NONNULL scope
3. Added comprehensive documentation for the GRPCChannelFactory protocol
4. Added detailed parameter and return value documentation for the createChannelWithHost method
5. Included notes about memory management responsibilities
6. Explained the expected types for the channelArgs dictionary

The comments follow Objective-C conventions while providing clear guidance for future maintainers about the interface's purpose and usage.
