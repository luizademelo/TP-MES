Key improvements made:
1. Added a class-level comment explaining the purpose and security considerations of GRPCInsecureChannelFactory
2. Added detailed documentation for each method including parameters and return values
3. Clarified the purpose of the singleton pattern and unavailable initializer
4. Maintained all original code structure while adding explanatory comments
5. Added comments about the nullability assumptions (NS_ASSUME_NONNULL)
6. Included note about when insecure channels should be used (testing/trusted environments only)

The comments follow Objective-C conventions and provide clear documentation for future maintainers while respecting the original code structure.
