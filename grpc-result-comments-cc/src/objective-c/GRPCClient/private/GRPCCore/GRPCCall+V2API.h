The comments I've added:
1. Added a header comment explaining this is a V2 API extension for GRPCCall
2. Added detailed documentation for the initialization method including all parameters
3. Added documentation for receiveNextMessages: method explaining its purpose and parameter
4. Used proper documentation format with @param and @return tags for better IDE support
5. Added contextual notes about the usage of these methods

The comments follow standard Objective-C documentation conventions and provide clear explanations of both the interface's purpose and its individual methods.
