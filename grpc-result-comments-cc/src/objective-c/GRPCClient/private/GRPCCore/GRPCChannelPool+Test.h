Key comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of the Test category extensions
2. Documented each method's purpose, parameters, and return value
3. Added notes about test-only visibility
4. Explained the wrappedChannel property's purpose and visibility
5. Added clarification about the NS_ASSUME_NONNULL scope
6. Maintained all original copyright and licensing information

The comments follow Objective-C documentation conventions while providing clear explanations of the test-only interfaces being exposed.
