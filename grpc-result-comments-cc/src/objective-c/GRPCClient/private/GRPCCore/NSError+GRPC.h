// Import Foundation framework for basic Objective-C functionality
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
// Import gRPC core library for status codes and core functionality
#include <grpc/grpc.h>

// Category extension for NSError to add gRPC-specific functionality
@interface NSError (GRPC)

/**
 * Creates and returns an NSError object from gRPC status information.
 *
 * @param statusCode The gRPC status code (grpc_status_code enum value)
 * @param details Additional error details as a C string (may be NULL)
 * @param errorString Error description as a C string (may be NULL)
 * @return An initialized NSError object populated with gRPC error information
 *
 * This method converts gRPC-specific error information (status code, details, and error string)
 * into a standard NSError object for use in Objective-C code. The resulting NSError will
 * contain the gRPC status code and any provided details in its userInfo dictionary.
 */
+ (instancetype)grpc_errorFromStatusCode:(grpc_status_code)statusCode
                                 details:(const char *)details

Key improvements made:
1. Added a comment explaining the purpose of the Foundation import
2. Added a comment explaining the gRPC import
3. Added documentation for the category extension
4. Added comprehensive documentation for the method including:
   - Description of what the method does
   - Parameter explanations
   - Return value explanation
   - Additional context about how the error information is structured

The comments follow Objective-C conventions and provide clear, useful information for developers who might need to use or maintain this code in the future.
