The comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of each included header
2. Added detailed documentation for each function including:
   - Purpose of the function
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return value information
   - Memory management responsibilities
   - Important usage notes
3. Used appropriate comment styles:
   - Single-line comments for simple explanations
   - Doxygen-style multi-line comments for API documentation

The comments maintain consistency with the existing license header and provide clear guidance for future developers using these functions.
