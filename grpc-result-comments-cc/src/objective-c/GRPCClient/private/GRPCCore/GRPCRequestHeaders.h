The comments provide:
1. Explanation of the class purpose (GRPCRequestHeaders)
2. Documentation for each method including parameters and return values
3. Clarification about which initializer is the designated one
4. Context about the relationship with GRPCCall objects
5. Note about the convenience initializer likely managing its own storage

The comments follow Objective-C conventions and provide enough information for future maintainers to understand and use the class correctly.
