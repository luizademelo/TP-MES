Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added a comprehensive class-level description explaining the purpose of GRPCCall2Internal
2. Added detailed documentation for each method including parameters and their purposes
3. Explained the significance of the NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN/END macros
4. Added @brief tags for quick scanning of method purposes
5. Included notes about important behaviors (like half-close for finish())
6. Documented the forward declarations to explain their purpose
7. Maintained all existing copyright and license information

The comments follow Objective-C documentation conventions while providing clear explanations of the code's functionality for future maintainers.
