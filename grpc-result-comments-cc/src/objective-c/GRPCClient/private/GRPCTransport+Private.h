The comments I've added:
1. Explained the purpose of the private interface extension
2. Documented each method's purpose, parameters, and return values
3. Added a class-level comment explaining GRPCTransportManager's role
4. Maintained the existing license header and import statements
5. Kept the nullability annotations (NS_ASSUME_NONNULL) as they were

The comments follow Objective-C conventions and provide clear explanations of each component's functionality while being concise enough to not overwhelm the reader.
