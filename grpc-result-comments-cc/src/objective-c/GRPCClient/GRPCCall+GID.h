Key points about the comments:
1. Added an explanation of the header imports and their purpose
2. Added a class-level comment explaining the purpose of the category extension
3. Added detailed documentation for the `getTokenWithHandler:` method including:
   - Its purpose (retrieving auth token)
   - Parameter description
   - Note about possible nil return value
   - Typical usage of the token

The comments follow Objective-C documentation conventions while providing clear explanations of the code's functionality and purpose.
