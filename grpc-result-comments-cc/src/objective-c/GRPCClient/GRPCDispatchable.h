/**
 * @protocol GRPCDispatchable
 * 
 * Defines an interface for objects that can provide a dispatch queue.
 * This is typically used to specify which queue callbacks or operations 
 * should be executed on in a multithreaded environment.
 *
 * The protocol requires implementers to provide a thread-safe way to access
 * their dispatch queue through the dispatchQueue property.
 */
@protocol GRPCDispatchable

/**
 * A Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) queue that can be used for executing tasks.
 *
 * @note The property is declared as atomic to ensure thread-safe access.
 * @note The readonly modifier indicates that only a getter is required,
 *       though implementers may choose to provide a setter if needed.

@property(atomic, readonly) dispatch_queue_t dispatchQueue;

```

The comments added explain:
1. The overall purpose of the GRPCDispatchable protocol
2. The significance of the dispatchQueue property
3. The threading implications of the atomic and readonly modifiers
4. The expected usage pattern for implementers of this protocol

The comments follow Objective-C/Swift documentation conventions while providing clear explanations for future maintainers.
