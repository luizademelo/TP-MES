// Importing the legacy GRPC call interface
#import "GRPCCallLegacy.h"

// Category extension of GRPCCall specifically for testing purposes
// This exposes testing-only methods while keeping them separate from the main interface
@interface GRPCCall (Tests)

// Configures test certificates for a specific host
// @param certsPath: Path to the directory containing test certificates
// @param testName: Name identifier for the test certificates
// @param host: The host for which to use these test certificates
+ (void)useTestCertsPath:(NSString *)certsPath
                testName:(NSString *)testName
                 forHost:(NSString *)host;

// Configures insecure (non-SSL) connections for a specific host
// This should only be used in testing environments
// @param host: The host for which to use insecure connections
+ (void)useInsecureConnectionsForHost:(NSString *)host;

// Resets all host-specific settings to their default values
// This is typically used between tests to ensure clean state
+ (void)resetHostSettings;

@end
```

The comments added:
1. Explain the purpose of the testing category extension
2. Document each method's purpose and parameters
3. Note important usage considerations (like testing-only usage)
4. Maintain the existing license header
5. Keep the original code structure while adding explanatory comments

The comments are designed to help future developers understand:
- Why these methods exist (for testing)
- When to use them
- What each parameter means
- Important security considerations (like insecure connections being test-only)
