Key comments added:
1. Added explanation for the file header and license
2. Noted the purpose of the GRPCCall import
3. Explained the forward declaration
4. Documented the category extension's purpose
5. Added detailed documentation for each method including:
   - Purpose of the method
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return value descriptions
   - Nullability annotations
   - Behavior notes

The comments follow standard Objective-C documentation style and provide clear information about the purpose and usage of each component.
