#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

// ProtoMethod is deprecated - use GRPCProtoMethod instead
// Represents a gRPC method with package, service, and method name components
__attribute__((deprecated("Please use GRPCProtoMethod.")))
@interface ProtoMethod : NSObject

// The package name for this gRPC method (e.g., "google.protobuf")
@property(nonatomic, readonly) NSString *package;

// The service name for this gRPC method (e.g., "Compiler")
@property(nonatomic, readonly) NSString *service;

// The method name for this gRPC method (e.g., "Compile")
@property(nonatomic, readonly) NSString *method;

// The HTTP path for this gRPC method (constructed from package/service/method)
@property(nonatomic, readonly) NSString *HTTPPath;

// Initializes a ProtoMethod with the given package, service, and method names
// Parameters:
//   package: The package name (e.g., "google.protobuf")
//   service: The service name (e.g., "Compiler")
//   method:  The method name (e.g., "Compile")
- (instancetype)initWithPackage:(NSString *)package
                        service:(NSString *)service

@end

// Temporarily disable deprecation warnings for the following interface
#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wdeprecated-declarations"

// GRPCProtoMethod is the replacement for ProtoMethod
// Currently inherits from ProtoMethod but may change in future versions
@interface GRPCProtoMethod : ProtoMethod

#pragma clang diagnostic pop

@end
```

Key comments added:
1. Added explanation of the deprecation notice
2. Documented the purpose of each property (package, service, method, HTTPPath)
3. Explained the initialization method parameters
4. Added context about the pragma directives suppressing warnings
5. Noted that GRPCProtoMethod is the replacement for ProtoMethod
6. Added a note about potential future changes to GRPCProtoMethod's implementation

The comments provide clear explanations while maintaining the original code structure and functionality.
