The comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of the GRPCProtoResponseHandler protocol and its methods
2. Documented the GRPCUnaryResponseHandler class and its properties
3. Added detailed parameter descriptions for the initializers
4. Explained the purpose of each method in both call classes
5. Clarified the difference between unary and streaming calls
6. Added notes about unavailable initializers
7. Explained the purpose of the responseClass parameter

The comments are designed to help future developers understand:
- The overall architecture of the gRPC client calls
- The flow of message handling
- The purpose of each class and method
- The expected parameters and their meanings
- The differences between unary and streaming calls
