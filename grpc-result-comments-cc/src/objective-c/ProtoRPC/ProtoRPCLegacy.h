Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added clear documentation for each interface and method
2. Explained the purpose of the deprecation
3. Documented parameters and return values
4. Explained the pragma directives for warning suppression
5. Added documentation for the utility function
6. Maintained the original license header
7. Used consistent formatting for documentation blocks

The comments now provide comprehensive information about the code's functionality, usage, and relationships between components, which will be valuable for future maintenance.
