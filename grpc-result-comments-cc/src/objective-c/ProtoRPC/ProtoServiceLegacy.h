/**
 * @header ProtoService.h
 * @brief Main header for gRPC proto service functionality in Objective-C
 * 
 * This file declares core classes and protocols needed for gRPC service
 * implementations using protocol buffers in Objective-C.
 */

// Forward class declarations to avoid full header imports
@class GRPCProtoCall;      // Represents a single gRPC call using protocol buffers
@class GRXWriter;         // Generic Reactive eXtensions writer interface for gRPC
@protocol GRXWriteable;    // Protocol for objects that can receive written values

/**
 * @interface ProtoService
 * @brief Base class for gRPC services generated from protocol buffer definitions
 * 
 * This class serves as the foundation for auto-generated gRPC service
 * implementations. It provides core functionality for making RPC calls
 * using protocol buffers as both request and response types.

#import "ProtoService.h"
```

Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added clear header documentation explaining the purpose of the file
2. Added detailed comments for each forward class declaration
3. Added documentation for the ProtoService interface
4. Improved the license comment to be more explanatory
5. Used consistent documentation style with @brief and @param tags
6. Added cross-references between related components
7. Explained the purpose of forward declarations

The comments now provide much better context for developers working with this code, especially those new to gRPC's Objective-C implementation.
