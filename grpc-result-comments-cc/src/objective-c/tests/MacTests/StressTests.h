// Import the common test base class that this test suite will extend

/**
 * @interface StressTests
 * @brief Test class for stress testing scenarios in gRPC.
 * 
 * This class inherits from TestBase and will contain stress test cases
 * to verify the robustness and stability of gRPC under heavy load or
 * extreme conditions.
 */
@interface StressTests : TestBase

@end
```

Key additions:
1. Added a brief description of the copyright block
2. Commented the XCTest import to explain its purpose
3. Commented the TestBase import to explain its relationship
4. Added comprehensive documentation for the StressTests interface including:
   - Purpose of the class
   - Inheritance relationship
   - Expected content (stress test cases)
   - Testing objectives (robustness and stability verification)
