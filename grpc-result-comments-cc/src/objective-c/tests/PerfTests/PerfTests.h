// Import XCTest framework for iOS/macOS unit testing functionality
#import <XCTest/XCTest.h>

// Import the base test class that this test suite will extend
#import "../Common/TestBase.h"

/**
 * Performance test suite class declaration.
 *
 * This class inherits from TestBase and will contain performance test cases
 * for evaluating the gRPC implementation. The test methods (not shown here)
 * would typically measure and validate the performance characteristics of
 * gRPC operations.
 */
@interface PerfTests : TestBase

@end
```

Key additions in the comments:
1. Added a summary comment for the copyright block
2. Explained the purpose of the XCTest import
3. Noted the relationship with the base test class
4. Added comprehensive class-level documentation explaining the purpose of the PerfTests class and what it would typically contain
5. Maintained all original license information and structure

The comments now provide better context about:
- Why the imports are needed
- The role of this class in the test suite
- The expected contents of the class (performance tests)
- The inheritance relationship with TestBase
