// Import the common test base class for shared test functionality

/**
 * @class InteropTests
 * @brief Test case class for gRPC interoperability tests
 * 
 * This class inherits from TestBase which provides common test infrastructure
 * and utilities for gRPC tests. It will contain test methods to verify
 * interoperability between different gRPC implementations.
 */
@interface InteropTests : TestBase

@end
```

Key additions:
1. Added a brief description of the copyright block's purpose
2. Commented the XCTest import explaining its role
3. Commented the TestBase import explaining its purpose
4. Added comprehensive class-level documentation for InteropTests including:
   - @class tag for class identification
   - @brief with a short description
   - Detailed explanation of the class's purpose and inheritance

The comments follow standard Objective-C documentation conventions while providing clear explanations for each significant part of the code.
