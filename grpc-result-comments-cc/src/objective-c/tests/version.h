// Current version string for gRPC Objective-C implementation
// Format: @"MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRE-RELEASE]"
#define GRPC_OBJC_VERSION_STRING @"1.74.0-dev"

// Current version string for gRPC C core implementation
// Format: "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"
#define GRPC_C_VERSION_STRING @"48.0.0"

```

The comments added:
1. Added a general description of what the file contains
2. Added specific comments explaining each version string:
   - Format of the version strings
   - Which implementation each one refers to (Objective-C vs C core)
3. Maintained all original copyright and license information
4. Kept the exact same code structure while adding explanatory comments

The comments are concise but provide important context about the version strings that would be helpful for maintenance and debugging.
