// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPC_INTERNAL_COMPILER_RUBY_GENERATOR_H
#define GRPC_INTERNAL_COMPILER_RUBY_GENERATOR_H

// Includes the configuration header needed for code generation
#include "src/compiler/config.h"

// Namespace for Ruby-specific code generation utilities in gRPC
namespace grpc_ruby_generator {

// Generates and returns Ruby service definitions from a Protocol Buffer file descriptor
// @param file The Protocol Buffer file descriptor containing service definitions
// @return A string containing the generated Ruby service code
std::string GetServices(const grpc::protobuf::FileDescriptor* file);

}  // namespace grpc_ruby_generator

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPC_INTERNAL_COMPILER_RUBY_GENERATOR_H
```

The comments added explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The inclusion of the config header
3. The namespace declaration's purpose
4. The GetServices function's purpose, parameter, and return value
5. The closing of the header guard

The comments are concise yet informative, providing enough context for future maintainers to understand the code's purpose and functionality without being overly verbose.
