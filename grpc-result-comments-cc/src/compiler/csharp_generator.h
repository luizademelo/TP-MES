Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added a general file description explaining the purpose of the header
2. Added detailed documentation for the `GetServices` function including:
   - A brief description of what it does
   - Documentation for each parameter
   - Information about the return value
3. Added comments for the namespace closure
4. Added a comment for the include directive
5. Improved the structure with section headers
6. Maintained all original copyright and license information

The comments now provide clear context for developers who need to:
- Understand what this header is for
- Use the `GetServices` function
- Modify or extend the functionality
- Integrate this component with other parts of the system
