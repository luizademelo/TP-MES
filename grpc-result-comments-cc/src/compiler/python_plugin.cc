 * 
 * This program acts as a protobuf compiler plugin that generates gRPC Python code.
 * It follows the protocol buffer compiler plugin specification.

 * @param argc Number of command-line arguments
 * @param argv Array of command-line argument strings
 * @return int Exit status (0 for success, non-zero for errors)

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each included header file
2. The overall role of the program as a protobuf compiler plugin
3. The main function's parameters and return value
4. Each step in the main execution flow
5. The relationship between the components

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context for future maintainers to understand the code's purpose and structure.
