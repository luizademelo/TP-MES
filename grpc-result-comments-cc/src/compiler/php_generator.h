Key improvements made:
1. Added a detailed comment explaining the purpose and usage of the `GenerateFile` function
2. Documented each parameter with its purpose and meaning
3. Added namespace closing comment for clarity
4. Added comment explaining the include statement
5. Added comment explaining the purpose of the namespace
6. Maintained all existing copyright and license information
7. Added clear indication of the header guard's purpose in the endif comment

The comments now provide clear documentation for developers who need to:
- Understand what this header provides
- Use the GenerateFile function
- Extend or modify the PHP generation functionality
- Understand the relationship between this component and Protocol Buffers
