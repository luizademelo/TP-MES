Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2021 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library and contains functionality for
// registering additional filters in the gRPC core configuration.

// Include necessary gRPC core headers
#include <grpc/grpc.h>                  // Main gRPC header
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>  // Platform-specific support utilities

// Include core configuration header
#include "src/core/config/core_configuration.h"

// Define the grpc_core namespace which contains core gRPC functionality
namespace grpc_core {

// Function to register extra filters with gRPC's core configuration
// Currently implemented as an empty function (no-op) but serves as a
// placeholder for future extensions where additional filters might be registered
//
// Parameters:
//   builder - Pointer to CoreConfiguration::Builder which would be used to
//             register filters (currently unused)
void RegisterExtraFilters(CoreConfiguration::Builder* /*builder*/) {}

}  // namespace grpc_core
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright and basic file purpose
2. Each include statement's purpose
3. The namespace context
4. The function's purpose and parameters
5. The current implementation status (empty placeholder)
6. The parameter's purpose (noted as currently unused with /* */ comment style)

The comments are designed to help future developers understand both what the code does now and its potential future purpose.
