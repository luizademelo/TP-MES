Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2017 gRPC authors.

// Platform-specific header for portability
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

// Include port-specific definitions
#include "src/core/lib/iomgr/port.h"

// Only include this implementation if GRPC_POSIX_FORK is not defined
// (i.e., this is for non-POSIX platforms like Windows)
#ifndef GRPC_POSIX_FORK

#include <grpc/fork.h>
#include "absl/log/log.h"

// NOTE: FORKING IS NOT GENERALLY SUPPORTED, THIS IS ONLY INTENDED TO WORK
// ON POSIX SYSTEMS. THESE ARE STUB IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR NON-POSIX PLATFORMS.

/// Stub implementation of prefork handler for platforms without fork support.
/// Logs an error message indicating forking is not supported.
void grpc_prefork() { LOG(ERROR) << "Forking not supported on Windows"; }

/// Stub implementation of postfork parent handler (no-op).
void grpc_postfork_parent() {}

/// Stub implementation of postfork child handler (no-op).
void grpc_postfork_child() {}

/// Stub implementation of auto-registration for fork handlers (no-op).
void grpc_fork_handlers_auto_register() {}

#endif  // GRPC_POSIX_FORK
```

The comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of each include
2. Clarified the conditional compilation block
3. Added documentation for each function
4. Maintained the original warning note but made it more prominent
5. Added clear indication that these are stub implementations for non-POSIX platforms
6. Added closing comment for the #ifndef block for better readability

The comments now clearly explain that these are placeholder implementations for platforms that don't support forking (like Windows), and that they either log errors or do nothing.
