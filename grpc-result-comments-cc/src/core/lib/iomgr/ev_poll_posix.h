Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2015-2016 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPC_SRC_CORE_LIB_IOMGR_EV_POLL_POSIX_H
#define GRPC_SRC_CORE_LIB_IOMGR_EV_POLL_POSIX_H

// Include platform-specific portability definitions
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

// Include the base POSIX event engine interface
#include "src/core/lib/iomgr/ev_posix.h"

// Declaration of the poll-based POSIX event engine virtual function table.
// This vtable contains function pointers for the poll-based event engine implementation.
extern const grpc_event_engine_vtable grpc_ev_poll_posix;

// Declaration of the "none" POSIX event engine virtual function table.
// This is a stub implementation used when no event engine is available.
extern const grpc_event_engine_vtable grpc_ev_none_posix;

#endif  // GRPC_SRC_CORE_LIB_IOMGR_EV_POLL_POSIX_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The included files and their purposes
3. The declarations of the two event engine vtables (poll-based and none)
4. The closing of the header guard

Each comment is placed close to the relevant code and explains the purpose or functionality of that specific part.
