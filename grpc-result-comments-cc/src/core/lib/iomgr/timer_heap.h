Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPC_SRC_CORE_LIB_IOMGR_TIMER_HEAP_H
#define GRPC_SRC_CORE_LIB_IOMGR_TIMER_HEAP_H

// Include platform-specific support macros and types
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

// Include the timer interface definitions
#include "src/core/lib/iomgr/timer.h"

// Structure representing a timer heap (priority queue for timers)
// The heap is implemented as an array of pointers to grpc_timer objects
struct grpc_timer_heap {
  grpc_timer** timers;      // Dynamic array of timer pointers
  uint32_t timer_count;     // Current number of timers in the heap
  uint32_t timer_capacity;  // Maximum capacity of the heap before resizing
};

// Adds a timer to the heap. Returns true if successful, false otherwise
bool grpc_timer_heap_add(grpc_timer_heap* heap, grpc_timer* timer);

// Initializes a timer heap structure (must be called before use)
void grpc_timer_heap_init(grpc_timer_heap* heap);

// Destroys a timer heap and releases all associated resources
void grpc_timer_heap_destroy(grpc_timer_heap* heap);

// Removes a specific timer from the heap
void grpc_timer_heap_remove(grpc_timer_heap* heap, grpc_timer* timer);

// Returns the timer with the earliest deadline (top of the heap) without removing it
grpc_timer* grpc_timer_heap_top(grpc_timer_heap* heap);

// Removes the timer with the earliest deadline (top of the heap)
void grpc_timer_heap_pop(grpc_timer_heap* heap);

// Checks if the timer heap is empty
bool grpc_timer_heap_is_empty(grpc_timer_heap* heap);

#endif  // GRPC_SRC_CORE_LIB_IOMGR_TIMER_HEAP_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each include directive
2. The structure and fields of grpc_timer_heap
3. The functionality and return values of each public API function
4. The overall purpose of this header file (to define a timer heap/priority queue interface)
5. Important usage notes (like the need to initialize before use)

The comments are concise yet informative, helping future developers understand both the interface and the expected behavior of each function.
