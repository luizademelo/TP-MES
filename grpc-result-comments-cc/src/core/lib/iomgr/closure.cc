Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2022 gRPC authors.

// Header file inclusion for closure functionality
#include "src/core/lib/iomgr/closure.h"

// Platform-specific support header from gRPC
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

// ABSL string formatting utilities
#include "absl/strings/str_format.h"

// Returns a debug string representation of the closure object
// In release builds (NDEBUG defined), returns just the pointer address
// In debug builds, returns pointer address along with creation location
// Format:
//   Release: "0x<address>"
//   Debug: "0x<address>|created=<filename>:<line>"
std::string grpc_closure::DebugString() const {
#ifdef NDEBUG
  // Release build - minimal information (just pointer address)
  return absl::StrFormat("%p", this);
#else
  // Debug build - includes pointer address and creation location
  return absl::StrFormat("%p|created=%s:%d", this, file_created, line_created);
#endif
}
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each include directive
2. The overall purpose of the DebugString() method
3. The difference in behavior between debug and release builds
4. The format of the output string in both cases
5. The specific elements being formatted in each version of the output
