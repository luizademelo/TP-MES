The comments provide:
1. File-level documentation about the purpose of the lock-free event
2. Explanation of each include directive
3. Documentation for each public method including parameters and return values
4. Documentation for the internal State enum values
5. Explanation of the atomic state variable
6. Notes about thread-safety and lock-free nature of the implementation
7. Clear separation between public interface and private implementation details

The comments are designed to help future developers understand:
- What the class does
- How to use it properly
- The thread-safety guarantees
- The meaning of internal states and flags
- The purpose of each method
