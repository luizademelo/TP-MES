Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPC_SRC_CORE_LIB_CHANNEL_CONNECTED_CHANNEL_H
#define GRPC_SRC_CORE_LIB_CHANNEL_CONNECTED_CHANNEL_H

// Includes platform-specific support macros and types
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

// Forward declarations for channel-related types
#include "src/core/lib/channel/channel_fwd.h"
// Channel stack implementation
#include "src/core/lib/channel/channel_stack.h"
// Channel stack builder interface
#include "src/core/lib/channel/channel_stack_builder.h"

// Declaration of the connected channel filter - this is the main filter
// that implements connected channel functionality in gRPC
extern const grpc_channel_filter grpc_connected_filter;

// Function to add the connected filter to a channel stack builder
// Parameters:
//   builder - Pointer to the ChannelStackBuilder to which the filter will be added
// Returns:
//   bool - True if the filter was successfully added, false otherwise
bool grpc_add_connected_filter(grpc_core::ChannelStackBuilder* builder);

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. Each include statement and its purpose
3. The external declaration of the connected channel filter
4. The function prototype with parameter and return value documentation

The comments maintain the original code structure while adding clear explanations of each component's role in the gRPC channel system.
