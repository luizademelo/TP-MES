The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each section and component
2. The role of the ChannelStackBuilderImpl class
3. The functionality of each method
4. The purpose of the blackboard members
5. The return value and error handling of the Build method
6. The relationship between this class and its parent class

The comments are designed to help future developers understand:
- What the code does
- How to use the class
- The purpose of each component
- Important implementation details
- The expected behavior of each method
