Here's the updated code with comprehensive comments:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Include necessary gRPC headers
#include <grpc/grpc.h>
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

/// @brief Returns the current version of the gRPC library
/// @return A static string containing the version number in "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" format
/// @note This is typically used for version checking and diagnostic purposes
const char* grpc_version_string(void) { return "48.0.0"; }

/// @brief Returns the meaning of 'g' in gRPC (a whimsical function)
/// @return A static string explaining what 'g' stands for in gRPC
/// @note This is primarily for fun/trivia and not used in actual functionality
const char* grpc_g_stands_for(void) { return "gee"; }
```

The comments include:
1. File-level copyright notice (preserved from original)
2. Brief explanation of header includes
3. Detailed documentation for each function including:
   - Purpose of the function
   - Return value description
   - Any special notes about usage
4. Doxygen-style tags (@brief, @return, @note) for better integration with documentation systems
5. Clear separation between the actual version reporting function and the whimsical "g stands for" function

The comments maintain a professional tone while still acknowledging the playful nature of the `grpc_g_stands_for` function.
