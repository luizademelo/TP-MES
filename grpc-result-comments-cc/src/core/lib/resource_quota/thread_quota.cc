Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2021 gRPC authors.

#include "src/core/lib/resource_quota/thread_quota.h"

#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

#include "absl/log/check.h"

namespace grpc_core {

// Default constructor for ThreadQuota class
ThreadQuota::ThreadQuota() = default;

// Destructor for ThreadQuota class
ThreadQuota::~ThreadQuota() = default;

// Sets the maximum number of threads allowed by this quota
// Args:
//   new_max: The new maximum thread count to set
// Notes:
//   - Thread-safe operation protected by mutex
//   - Overwrites any previous maximum value
void ThreadQuota::SetMax(size_t new_max) {
  MutexLock lock(&mu_);
  max_ = new_max;
}

// Attempts to reserve a number of threads within the quota
// Args:
//   num_threads: Number of threads to reserve
// Returns:
//   true if the reservation was successful (enough quota available)
//   false if the reservation failed (would exceed max quota)
// Notes:
//   - Thread-safe operation protected by mutex
//   - If successful, increases the allocated thread count
bool ThreadQuota::Reserve(size_t num_threads) {
  MutexLock lock(&mu_);
  if (allocated_ + num_threads > max_) return false;
  allocated_ += num_threads;
  return true;
}

// Releases a number of previously reserved threads back to the quota
// Args:
//   num_threads: Number of threads to release
// Notes:
//   - Thread-safe operation protected by mutex
//   - Uses CHECK to verify we don't release more threads than allocated
//   - Decreases the allocated thread count
void ThreadQuota::Release(size_t num_threads) {
  MutexLock lock(&mu_);
  CHECK(num_threads <= allocated_);
  allocated_ -= num_threads;
}

}  // namespace grpc_core
```

The comments provide:
1. Class-level documentation for constructors/destructors
2. Detailed function documentation including:
   - Purpose of each function
   - Parameter descriptions
   - Return values (where applicable)
   - Thread safety notes
   - Important implementation details
   - Side effects
3. Clear explanation of the mutex-protected operations
4. Note about the CHECK assertion in Release()
5. Namespace closing comment

The comments follow a consistent style and provide all the key information a developer would need to understand and maintain this thread quota implementation.
