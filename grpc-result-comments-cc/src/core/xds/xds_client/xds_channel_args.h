Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2019 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPC_SRC_CORE_XDS_XDS_CLIENT_XDS_CHANNEL_ARGS_H
#define GRPC_SRC_CORE_XDS_XDS_CLIENT_XDS_CHANNEL_ARGS_H

// Definition of a channel argument key for XDS client channel configuration.
// This is marked as test-only and should not be used in production environments.
// It allows passing custom channel arguments specifically for XDS client testing.
#define GRPC_ARG_TEST_ONLY_DO_NOT_USE_IN_PROD_XDS_CLIENT_CHANNEL_ARGS \
  "grpc.xds_client_channel_args"

// Definition of a channel argument key that specifies the timeout (in milliseconds)
// for when an XDS resource is determined to not exist. This controls how long
// the client should wait before concluding that a requested resource doesn't exist.
#define GRPC_ARG_XDS_RESOURCE_DOES_NOT_EXIST_TIMEOUT_MS \
  "grpc.xds_resource_does_not_exist_timeout_ms"

#endif  // GRPC_SRC_CORE_XDS_XDS_CLIENT_XDS_CHANNEL_ARGS_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The test-only nature of the first channel argument and its intended use case
3. The purpose and functionality of the timeout channel argument
4. The closing of the header guard with a matching comment

The comments are clear, concise, and provide context about when and how these definitions should be used.
