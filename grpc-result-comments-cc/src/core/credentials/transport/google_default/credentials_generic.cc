 * 2. If the environment variable is not set, logs an error and returns an empty string
 * 3. If found, combines the base path with a standard suffix to form the full file path

The comments provide:
1. A detailed function header explaining the purpose and behavior
2. Explanation of the return value
3. Inline comments explaining each logical step
4. Clear indication of error conditions and their handling
5. Note about the empty string return value indicating failure

The comments follow good practices by explaining the "why" behind the code, not just the "what". They're also properly formatted for documentation generation tools.
