Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2025 gRPC authors.

// Include the header file for the SharedBitGen class implementation
#include "src/core/util/shared_bit_gen.h"

namespace grpc_core {

// Define a thread-local instance of absl::BitGen for the SharedBitGen class
// This ensures each thread has its own independent random number generator
// instance, preventing contention between threads and ensuring thread-safety
// without requiring synchronization mechanisms
thread_local absl::BitGen SharedBitGen::bit_gen_;

}  // namespace grpc_core
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the include directive
2. The thread-local storage specifier and why it's important
3. The type being stored (absl::BitGen) and its relationship to SharedBitGen
4. The benefits of this design (thread-safety and performance)
5. Proper namespace closing with identifier for better readability
