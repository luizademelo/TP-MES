Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2023 gRPC authors.

#include "src/core/util/random_early_detection.h"

#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

#include "absl/random/distributions.h"

namespace grpc_core {

// Implements Random Early Detection (RED) algorithm for queue management.
// This helps prevent queue overflow by randomly dropping packets before
// the queue becomes full, which helps avoid congestion.
bool RandomEarlyDetection::Reject(uint64_t size, absl::BitGenRef bitsrc) const {
  // If current queue size is below the soft limit, never reject
  if (size <= soft_limit_) return false;
  
  // If queue size is between soft and hard limits, calculate rejection probability
  if (size < hard_limit_) {
    // The rejection probability increases linearly from 0 to 1 as the queue size
    // grows from soft_limit_ to hard_limit_
    return absl::Bernoulli(bitsrc,
                           static_cast<double>(size - soft_limit_) /
                               static_cast<double>(hard_limit_ - soft_limit_));
  }
  
  // If queue size exceeds hard limit, always reject
  return true;
}

}  // namespace grpc_core
```

The comments explain:
1. The overall purpose of the Random Early Detection algorithm
2. The three different cases for queue size:
   - Below soft limit (never reject)
   - Between soft and hard limits (probabilistic rejection)
   - Above hard limit (always reject)
3. The linear probability calculation for the middle case
4. The use of absl::Bernoulli for probabilistic decision making

The comments are placed to maintain good readability while providing clear explanations of both the high-level algorithm and the implementation details.
