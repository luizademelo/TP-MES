Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++

// Platform-specific header for portability
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

// Header for platform-specific I/O manager port definitions
#include "src/core/lib/iomgr/port.h"

// This implementation is used when either:
// 1. GRPC_IF_NAMETOINDEX is 0 (feature disabled), or
// 2. GRPC_POSIX_SOCKET_IF_NAMETOINDEX is not defined (platform doesn't support it)
#if GRPC_IF_NAMETOINDEX == 0 || !defined(GRPC_POSIX_SOCKET_IF_NAMETOINDEX)

// Include logging utilities
#include "absl/log/log.h"
// Include crash reporting utilities

/**
 * Stub implementation of interface name to index conversion.
 * This function is used when the platform doesn't support interface name to index conversion.
 * 
 * @param name The interface name to convert (unused in this implementation)
 * @return Always returns 0 indicating no index was found, with appropriate logging
 */
uint32_t grpc_if_nametoindex(char* name) {
  // Log at verbose level 2 that we're not attempting the conversion
  VLOG(2) << "Not attempting to convert interface name " << name
          << " to index for current platform.";
  // Return 0 as this platform doesn't support the functionality
  return 0;
}

#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each include
2. The conditions under which this code is compiled
3. The function's behavior and parameters
4. The logging behavior
5. The return value meaning
6. The overall context of this being a stub implementation for unsupported platforms
