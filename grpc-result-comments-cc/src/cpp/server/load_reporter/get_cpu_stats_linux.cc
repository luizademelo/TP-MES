Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.

// Platform-specific header for portability
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

// For std::pair utility
#include <utility>

// Only compile this code on Linux systems
#ifdef GPR_LINUX

// For uint64_t and PRIu64 (portable format specifier)
#include <inttypes.h>
// For FILE operations
#include <cstdio>
// Header for CPU stats functionality
#include "src/cpp/server/load_reporter/get_cpu_stats.h"

namespace grpc {
namespace load_reporter {

// Returns CPU utilization statistics as a pair of:
// - busy: sum of user, nice, and system CPU time
// - total: sum of busy and idle CPU time
std::pair<uint64_t, uint64_t> GetCpuStatsImpl() {
  uint64_t busy = 0, total = 0;
  FILE* fp;
  
  // Open the Linux kernel's CPU statistics file
  fp = fopen("/proc/stat", "r");
  
  // Variables to store CPU time components from /proc/stat
  uint64_t user, nice, system, idle;
  
  // Read the first line of /proc/stat (aggregate CPU stats)
  // Format: "cpu user nice system idle ..."
  if (fscanf(fp, "cpu %" PRIu64 " %" PRIu64 " %" PRIu64 " %" PRIu64, &user,
             &nice, &system, &idle) != 4) {
    // If reading fails, set all values to 0 as fallback
    user = nice = system = idle = 0;
  }
  
  // Close the file after reading
  fclose(fp);
  
  // Calculate busy time (sum of user, nice, and system time)
  busy = user + nice + system;
  
  // Calculate total time (busy + idle)
  total = busy + idle;
  
  // Return the pair of (busy, total) CPU times
  return std::pair(busy, total);
}

}  // namespace load_reporter
}  // namespace grpc

#endif  // GPR_LINUX
```

Key improvements in the comments:
1. Added explanation of the function's purpose and return values
2. Documented the /proc/stat file format being read
3. Explained the fallback behavior when reading fails
4. Clarified the calculations being performed
5. Added namespace closing comments
6. Explained the platform-specific compilation (#ifdef)
7. Added comments for each major code block
8. Documented the purpose of included headers

The comments now provide a clear understanding of what the code does, how it works, and its dependencies.
