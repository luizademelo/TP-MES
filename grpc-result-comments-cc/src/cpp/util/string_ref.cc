Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Include necessary headers
#include <grpcpp/support/string_ref.h>  // Header for string_ref class
#include <stddef.h>                     // Standard definitions including size_t

// gRPC namespace
namespace grpc {

// Static member initialization for string_ref class
// npos is a special value indicating "not found" or "all remaining characters"
// It's initialized to the maximum possible value of size_t (-1 cast to size_t)
const size_t string_ref::npos = static_cast<size_t>(-1);

}  // namespace grpc
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each include directive
2. The namespace declaration
3. The initialization of the static `npos` member variable, including:
   - Its purpose as a special "not found" indicator
   - How it gets its value (maximum possible size_t value)
   - The use of static_cast for type safety

The comments are concise yet informative enough to help future maintainers understand the code's intent and implementation.
