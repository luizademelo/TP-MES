Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Include necessary headers
#include <grpcpp/support/status.h>  // For Status class definition
#include <memory>                   // For std::shared_ptr support

// gRPC namespace containing core functionality
namespace grpc {

// Static constant representing a successful OK status
// This is a default-constructed Status object (status code = OK, empty message)
const Status& Status::OK = Status();

// Static constant representing a CANCELLED operation status
// Constructed with CANCELLED status code and empty message
const Status& Status::CANCELLED = Status(StatusCode::CANCELLED, "");

}  // namespace grpc
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each include directive
2. The namespace context
3. The two static Status constants (OK and CANCELLED) that are commonly used in gRPC operations
4. How each constant is constructed
5. The significance of each status code

The comments follow a clear and concise style while providing useful information about the code's purpose and implementation.
