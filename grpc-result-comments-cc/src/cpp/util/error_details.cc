Here's the updated code with more detailed comments:

```c++
// Copyright 2017 gRPC authors.
// This header file provides support for handling and processing gRPC error details.

// Includes the gRPC C++ error details support header which contains:
// - Utilities for extracting and processing rich error details from gRPC statuses
// - Functions for converting between protocol buffer error details and gRPC status
// - Helper classes for managing error metadata in gRPC applications
#include <grpcpp/support/error_details.h>
```

The comments now provide:
1. A clear description of what this file is for (handling gRPC error details)
2. Information about what functionality the included header provides
3. Context about the types of utilities developers can expect to find in the error_details.h header

The comments are concise but informative, helping future developers understand the purpose and scope of this code snippet without being overly verbose.
