Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright notice indicating this code is part of gRPC project from 2015
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Include the header file for gRPC's RPC method implementation
// This provides the base functionality for Remote Procedure Call methods
#include <grpcpp/impl/rpc_method.h>

// Declare the top-level grpc namespace
// This namespace contains all core gRPC functionality and classes
namespace grpc {}

// Note: This appears to be a minimal header/skeleton file that:
// 1. Includes necessary dependencies
// 2. Declares the main gRPC namespace
// 3. Serves as a foundation for more complex gRPC implementations
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the included header
3. The namespace declaration
4. An overall note about the file's purpose as a foundation for gRPC implementations

The original code is quite minimal, so the comments provide context about what this file is likely part of (the gRPC framework) and its basic structure.
