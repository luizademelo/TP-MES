The comments added explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. Platform-specific includes and their purposes
3. The meaning of platform definition macros (ADDRESS_SORTING_WINDOWS/POSIX)
4. The purpose of the _GNU_SOURCE definition
5. The function prototype's purpose
6. The overall structure of the header file

The comments are kept concise while providing enough information for future maintainers to understand the code's purpose and structure.
