Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2023 Google LLC.  All rights reserved.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef UPB_BASE_UPCAST_H_
#define UPB_BASE_UPCAST_H_

// Include platform-specific definitions
#include "upb/port/def.inc"

// Macro to perform an upcast operation in upb (micro protobuf) library
// This is used internally to access the base structure from a derived structure
// The 'x' parameter is a pointer to a derived structure
// The macro accesses the 'base' field (with a special suffix indicating it's for internal use only)
// and returns its address, effectively upcasting to the base type
// WARNING: The suffix '_dont_copy_me__upb_internal_use_only' indicates this is for internal use
//          and should not be used directly in normal code
#define UPB_UPCAST(x) (&(x)->base##_dont_copy_me__upb_internal_use_only)

// Undefine any platform-specific macros that were defined by def.inc
#include "upb/port/undef.inc"

#endif  // UPB_BASE_UPCAST_H_
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The inclusion of platform-specific definitions
3. The functionality and purpose of the UPB_UPCAST macro
4. The warning about internal use
5. The purpose of undefining platform-specific macros
6. The closing of the header guard

The comments make it clear that this is internal functionality that should be used with caution, and explain the type conversion (upcasting) operation being performed.
