Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2023 Google LLC.  All rights reserved.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef UPB_MESSAGE_MAP_GENCODE_UTIL_H_
#define UPB_MESSAGE_MAP_GENCODE_UTIL_H_

// TODO: b/399481227 - Remove this header file, after all the references are
// cleaned up. This is a temporary header that should be eliminated once
// all dependencies on it have been removed from the codebase.

// End of header guard
#endif  // UPB_MESSAGE_MAP_GENCODE_UTIL_H_
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The TODO item explaining this is a temporary header to be removed
3. The closing of the header guard with a more descriptive comment

I've also added the header name to the closing #endif comment, which is a common practice to make it clearer which header file the guard belongs to.
