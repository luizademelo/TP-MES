Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2023 Google LLC.  All rights reserved.

// Include necessary headers for testing and protocol buffer functionality
#include <gtest/gtest.h>               // Google Test framework
#include "upb/reflection/def.hpp"      // upb reflection definitions
#include "upb/test/proto3_test.upb.h"  // Generated protocol buffer test messages
#include "upb/test/proto3_test.upbdefs.h" // Generated protocol buffer definitions

// Test case for verifying synthetic oneof extension functionality in proto3
TEST(Proto3Test, SyntheticOneofExtension) {
  // Create a definition pool for managing protocol buffer definitions
  upb::DefPool defpool;
  
  // Get the message definition for TestMessage3 from the definition pool
  upb::MessageDefPtr md(upb_test_TestMessage3_getmsgdef(defpool.ptr()));
  
  // Verify that the message definition contains exactly 6 fields
  // This tests that the synthetic oneof extension is properly included
  // in the field count for proto3 messages
  ASSERT_EQ(md.field_count(), 6);
}
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each included header file
2. The overall purpose of the test case
3. Each step of the test logic
4. The significance of the assertion checking for 6 fields
5. How this relates to synthetic oneof extensions in protocol buffers version 3

The comments are designed to help future maintainers understand:
- Why this test exists
- What it's verifying
- How the protocol buffer system is being used
- What the expected behavior should be
