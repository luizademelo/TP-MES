Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2023 Google LLC.  All rights reserved.

// Include necessary headers for testing and generated protobuf code
#include <gtest/gtest.h>  // Google Test framework for unit testing
#include "upb/test/test_import_empty_srcs.upb_minitable.h"  // Generated protobuf mini-table for testing

// Test case to verify that re-exported message types are properly initialized
// This test checks that the size of the initialized message structure is greater than 0,
// which confirms that the message type was properly generated and imported
TEST(Test, Reexport) {
  // Assert that the size of the initialized message structure is greater than 0
  // This ensures the message descriptor was properly generated and is non-empty
  ASSERT_GT(sizeof(upb_0test__ContainsImported_msg_init), 0);
}
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of each include directive
2. The overall purpose of the test case
3. What the specific assertion is verifying
4. Why this verification is important (confirming proper message generation and import)

The test appears to be validating that a protobuf message type was properly generated and imported by checking that its initialized message structure has a non-zero size.
