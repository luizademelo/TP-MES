Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef UPB_IO_CHUNKED_OUTPUT_STREAM_H_
#define UPB_IO_CHUNKED_OUTPUT_STREAM_H_

// Include necessary headers:
// - Zero copy output stream interface
// - Arena memory management
#include "upb/io/zero_copy_output_stream.h"
#include "upb/mem/arena.h"

// Include platform-specific definitions
#include "upb/port/def.inc"

// C++ compatibility: ensure functions have C linkage when compiled as C++
#ifdef __cplusplus

#endif

/**
 * Creates a new chunked output stream.
 *
 * @param data    Pointer to the buffer where data will be written
 * @param size    Size of the provided buffer
 * @param limit   Maximum amount of data the stream is allowed to write
 * @param arena   Memory arena for allocation (must outlive the returned stream)
 * @return        A pointer to the newly created zero-copy output stream
 *
 * The chunked output stream allows writing data in chunks while maintaining
 * a zero-copy interface. The stream will write to the provided buffer until
 * either the buffer is full or the limit is reached.

                                                      size_t limit,

```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of header guards
2. Why each include is needed
3. The C++ compatibility block
4. Detailed documentation for the function including parameters and return value
5. The purpose of the undef include
6. The closing of the header guard

The function documentation follows standard format with `@param` and `@return` tags and explains the overall purpose of the chunked output stream.
