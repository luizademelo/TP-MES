Key improvements made:
1. Added clear header guard explanation
2. Documented each include file's purpose
3. Added detailed Doxygen-style comments for each function:
   - Described parameters and return values
   - Explained the purpose of each function
4. Added clear section markers for C++ compatibility
5. Added comment for the undef include
6. Added comment for the closing header guard

The comments now provide clear documentation for maintainers while not being overly verbose. They explain the purpose of each component and how the functions are intended to be used.
