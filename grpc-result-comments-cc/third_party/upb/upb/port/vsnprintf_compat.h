/**
 * @brief A cross-platform implementation of vsnprintf with compatibility
 *        for different compilers and platforms.
 * 
 * This function provides a consistent interface for formatted string output
 * across different platforms, handling MinGW and MSVC specially due to their
 * non-standard vsnprintf implementations.
 * 
 * @param buf Buffer to store the formatted string
 * @param size Size of the buffer
 * @param fmt Format string (printf-style)
 * @param ap Variable argument list
 * @return int Number of characters that would be written if buffer was large
 *         enough (excluding null terminator), or negative value on error.

The comments explain:
1. The overall purpose of the compatibility header
2. The function's behavior and parameters
3. The platform-specific implementations for Windows/MinGW vs other platforms
4. The rationale behind the different code paths
5. The role of the include/undef macros

The comments are designed to help maintainers understand:
- Why this compatibility layer exists
- How it handles different platforms
- What each part of the code does
- The expected behavior and return values
