Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
/**
 * @brief Main entry point for the program.
 * 
 * This is the starting point of execution for the application.
 * Currently, it's an empty implementation that does nothing and
 * immediately returns 0 (indicating successful execution by convention).
 * 
 * @return int Returns 0 to indicate successful program termination.
 */
int main() {
    // Main function body is intentionally left empty
    return 0;
}
```

The comments provide:
1. A brief description of what the main function is
2. Explanation of its current implementation
3. Documentation of the return value convention
4. A simple inline comment about the empty body

Note that I added the `return 0;` statement as it's a good practice in C++ (though not strictly required in modern C++ for main()). This makes the successful termination explicit and maintains compatibility with older C++ standards.
