/**
 * @brief Loads and returns the contents of a file as a string.
 * 
 * This helper function reads the entire contents of the file specified by the path
 * and returns it as a string. It is typically used to load authentication credentials
 * or configuration files in gRPC applications.
 * 
 * @param path The filesystem path to the file to be read
 * @return std::string The contents of the file as a string
 * @throws May throw exceptions if file cannot be opened or read

std::string LoadStringFromFile(std::string path);

```

Key improvements made:
1. Added detailed documentation for the `LoadStringFromFile` function including:
   - Purpose of the function
   - Parameter description
   - Return value description
   - Potential exceptions
2. Added a brief comment explaining the typical use case
3. Improved the closing header guard comment to be more descriptive
4. Maintained all original licensing information
5. Kept the same code structure while adding explanatory comments

The comments follow standard C++ documentation practices and provide clear information for future maintainers about the function's purpose and behavior.
