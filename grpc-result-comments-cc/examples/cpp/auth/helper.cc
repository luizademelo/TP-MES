 * @brief Loads the entire contents of a file into a string.
 * 
 * This function opens the specified file, reads its entire contents,
 * and returns them as a string. If the file cannot be opened,
 * it prints an error message and terminates the program.
 * 
 * @param path The filesystem path to the file to be read.
 * @return std::string The contents of the file as a string.
 * @note The function will abort the program if the file cannot be opened.
 * @warning This function loads the entire file into memory at once,
 *          which may be problematic for very large files.

The comments added include:
1. File header comments explaining the license (already present)
2. Brief explanations for the included headers
3. Detailed function documentation using Doxygen-style comments that explain:
   - The function's purpose
   - Parameters
   - Return value
   - Important notes and warnings
4. Inline comments explaining key operations within the function
5. Notes about error handling behavior

The comments are designed to help future developers understand:
- What the function does
- How to use it
- Its limitations (like potential memory issues with large files)
- Its error handling behavior
- The flow of operations within the function
