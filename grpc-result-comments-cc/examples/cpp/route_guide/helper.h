Key improvements made:
1. Added detailed documentation for each function including:
   - Brief description of purpose
   - Parameter explanations
   - Return value explanation (where applicable)
2. Added namespace end comment for clarity
3. Added clear header guard end comment
4. Explained the forward declaration of Feature class
5. Used consistent documentation style (Doxygen-style comments)
6. Added details about what the functions do with their parameters

The comments now provide clear guidance for future developers about:
- What each function does
- What parameters are expected
- Where data comes from and goes to
- The overall purpose of this helper header
