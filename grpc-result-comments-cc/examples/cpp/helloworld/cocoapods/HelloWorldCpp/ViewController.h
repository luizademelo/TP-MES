// Import UIKit framework which provides fundamental iOS UI classes and infrastructure
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

/**
 * ViewController interface declaration.
 * This serves as the main view controller class for the iOS application.
 * Inherits from UIViewController, the base class for view controllers in UIKit.
 * The implementation would contain logic for managing the app's main view and handling user interactions.
 */
@interface ViewController : UIViewController
@end
```

The comments added explain:
1. The purpose of the UIKit import
2. The role of the ViewController interface and its inheritance from UIViewController
3. What developers can expect to find in the implementation (though it's not shown in this snippet)

The existing license header is maintained as-is since it's properly formatted and doesn't need modification.
