// Import Cocoa framework which provides core functionality for macOS applications
#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>

// ViewController interface declaration
// This class inherits from NSViewController, which manages a view hierarchy in a macOS app
// NSViewController is part of the AppKit framework (included via Cocoa.h)
@interface ViewController : NSViewController

// Note: No additional properties or methods are declared in this header
// Implementation would typically be in a corresponding .m file

@end
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the Cocoa import
2. The ViewController interface declaration and its inheritance from NSViewController
3. A note about where implementation would typically be found
4. The fact that this is currently just a basic declaration without any additional properties or methods
