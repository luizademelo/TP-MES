The comments provide:
1. A clear explanation of the copyright and licensing information
2. Documentation for the UIKit import statement
3. Detailed description of the AppDelegate's purpose and inheritance
4. Explanation of the window property's role in the application

The comments follow Objective-C/Swift documentation conventions while maintaining clarity for future maintainers.
