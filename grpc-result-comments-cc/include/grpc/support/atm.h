#ifndef GRPC_SUPPORT_ATM_H
#define GRPC_SUPPORT_ATM_H

// Include platform-specific configuration
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

// Platform-specific atomic operation implementations
// The selection is based on preprocessor definitions:
// 1. Prefer GCC atomic built-ins if available
#if defined(GPR_GCC_ATOMIC)
#include <grpc/support/atm_gcc_atomic.h>
// 2. Fall back to GCC sync operations if atomic built-ins aren't available
#elif defined(GPR_GCC_SYNC)
#include <grpc/support/atm_gcc_sync.h>
// 3. Use Windows atomic operations on Windows platforms
#elif defined(GPR_WINDOWS_ATOMIC)
#include <grpc/support/atm_windows.h>
// 4. Fail compilation if no suitable atomic implementation is found
#else
#error could not determine platform for atm
#endif

#endif /* GRPC_SUPPORT_ATM_H */
```

Key comments added:
1. Added explanation for the platform-specific configuration include
2. Documented the platform selection logic for atomic operations, showing the priority order
3. Added clear markers for each platform case (GCC atomic, GCC sync, Windows)
4. Explained the fallback behavior and the compilation error case
5. Added proper closing comment for the header guard

The comments now clearly explain:
- The purpose of the file (atomic operations abstraction)
- The platform selection strategy
- The fallback mechanism
- The behavior when no suitable implementation is found
