Key additions:
1. Added a comment explaining the purpose of `port_platform.h` inclusion
2. Added comments explaining the `extern "C"` wrapper purpose
3. Added detailed documentation for the `gpr_format_message` function including:
   - Purpose of the function
   - Parameter description
   - Return value description and memory management responsibility
4. Added a closing comment for the header guard to make it more readable
5. Maintained all original copyright and license information

The comments now provide clear context about the file's purpose and usage while preserving all the original code functionality.
