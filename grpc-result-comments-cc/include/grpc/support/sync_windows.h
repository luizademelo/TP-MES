The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header file (Windows-specific synchronization primitives)
2. The platform-specific conditional compilation
3. Each synchronization primitive type (mutex, condition variable, and one-time initialization)
4. The structure of the mutex type including its components
5. The purpose of the GPR_ONCE_INIT macro
6. The relationship with the generic synchronization interface

The comments are placed to help future developers understand:
- The Windows-specific implementations of synchronization primitives
- How these types map to native Windows synchronization objects
- The overall structure of the synchronization support for gRPC on Windows
