Key improvements made:
1. Added detailed comments explaining each synchronization primitive
2. Documented the purpose of each structure field
3. Explained the atomic nature of the operations
4. Clarified the purpose of the initializer macros
5. Added header guard comment
6. Added comments for the included headers
7. Maintained consistent comment style throughout

The comments now provide clear explanations of:
- What each synchronization primitive is for
- How thread-safety is achieved (through atomic operations)
- The purpose of each field in the structures
- The initialization macros
- The overall purpose of the header file
