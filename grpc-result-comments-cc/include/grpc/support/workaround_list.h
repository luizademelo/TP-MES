#ifndef GRPC_SUPPORT_WORKAROUND_LIST_H
#define GRPC_SUPPORT_WORKAROUND_LIST_H

/**
 * @file
 * @brief Header file defining workaround identifiers for gRPC.
 *
 * This file provides a mechanism to enumerate and identify specific workarounds
 * implemented in the gRPC codebase. Workarounds are typically solutions for
 * platform-specific or compiler-specific issues.
 */

/**
 * @enum grpc_workaround_list
 * @brief Enumeration of gRPC workaround identifiers.
 *
 * Currently contains only a single value (GRPC_MAX_WORKAROUND_ID) which serves
 * as both a placeholder and a way to determine the maximum workaround ID.
 * Additional workarounds can be added as needed by expanding this enum.
 */
typedef enum { 
    GRPC_MAX_WORKAROUND_ID  ///< Sentinel value representing the maximum workaround ID
} grpc_workaround_list;

#endif /* GRPC_SUPPORT_WORKAROUND_LIST_H */
```

Key additions:
1. Added a file-level comment explaining the purpose of the header
2. Added detailed documentation for the enum and its purpose
3. Documented the enum value with its meaning
4. Added a closing comment for the #endif directive
5. Used Doxygen-style comments (@file, @brief, @enum) for better documentation generation

The comments now clearly explain:
- The purpose of this header file
- What the grpc_workaround_list enum represents
- The role of GRPC_MAX_WORKAROUND_ID
- That this is designed to be expandable for future workarounds
