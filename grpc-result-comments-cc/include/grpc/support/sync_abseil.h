#ifndef GRPC_SUPPORT_SYNC_ABSEIL_H
#define GRPC_SUPPORT_SYNC_ABSEIL_H

// Include generic synchronization primitives
#include <grpc/support/sync_generic.h>

// Only define Abseil synchronization types if GPR_ABSEIL_SYNC is defined
#ifdef GPR_ABSEIL_SYNC

// Define synchronization primitives using Abseil implementation:
// - gpr_mu: Mutex type (using intptr_t for platform compatibility)
// - gpr_cv: Condition variable type (using intptr_t for platform compatibility)
// - gpr_once: One-time initialization type (using int32_t)

// Initializer value for gpr_once

#endif  // GRPC_SUPPORT_SYNC_ABSEIL_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header file (Abseil synchronization support)
2. The included dependencies and their roles
3. The conditional compilation block for Abseil synchronization
4. Each type definition and its purpose
5. The initialization macro for one-time initialization
6. The closing of conditional and header guards

The comments maintain technical accuracy while being clear and helpful for future maintenance.
