Key comments added:
1. Explained the purpose of the header guard
2. Documented the platform-specific include
3. Explained the C++ compatibility extern "C" block
4. Added detailed documentation for the thread ID type
5. Documented the gpr_thd_currentid function including its purpose and return value
6. Noted the significance of the GPRAPI macro
7. Added clear closing comment for the header guard

The comments maintain the original license header and provide clear explanations of each significant part of the code while following standard C/C++ documentation practices.
