/**
 * @file
 * @brief Header file defining byte buffer functionality for gRPC.
 * 
 * This file serves as a wrapper/include for the byte buffer implementation
 * in gRPC. It provides the necessary declarations for working with byte buffers
 * while abstracting the platform-specific details.
 */

#ifndef GRPC_IMPL_CODEGEN_BYTE_BUFFER_H
#define GRPC_IMPL_CODEGEN_BYTE_BUFFER_H

// Include platform-specific configuration first to ensure proper setup
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

// Include the main byte buffer interface
#include <grpc/byte_buffer.h>

#endif /* GRPC_IMPL_CODEGEN_BYTE_BUFFER_H */
```

Key additions in the comments:
1. Added a file description explaining the purpose of this header
2. Noted that this is a wrapper/include file for byte buffer functionality
3. Explained the inclusion order (platform-specific config first)
4. Added a comment for the main byte buffer include
5. Improved the endif comment to follow common C++ header guard conventions

The comments now provide context about:
- The file's role in the gRPC system
- Why the includes are ordered the way they are
- What functionality developers can expect from this header
- The relationship between this and other gRPC headers
