#ifndef GRPC_IMPL_CODEGEN_SYNC_WINDOWS_H
#define GRPC_IMPL_CODEGEN_SYNC_WINDOWS_H

/* Include platform-specific configuration */
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

/* Include Windows-specific synchronization primitives implementation */
#include <grpc/support/sync_windows.h>

#endif /* GRPC_IMPL_CODEGEN_SYNC_WINDOWS_H */
```

Key comments added:
1. Added a brief description of the `port_platform.h` include
2. Explained the purpose of the `sync_windows.h` include
3. Added an end-of-header comment to clarify what the `#endif` corresponds to

The comments help future developers understand:
- The platform-specific nature of this header
- That this is part of gRPC's Windows-specific synchronization implementation
- The structure of the include guards
