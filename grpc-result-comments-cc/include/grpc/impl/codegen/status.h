/**
 * @file
 * @brief Header guard and includes for gRPC status codes implementation.
 * 
 * This file serves as the implementation details for gRPC status codes.
 * It ensures proper platform support and includes the public status definitions.
 */

#ifndef GRPC_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_H
#define GRPC_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_H

// Include platform-specific configuration first
#include <grpc/support/port_platform.h>

// Include the public gRPC status definitions
#include <grpc/status.h>

#endif /* GRPC_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_H */
```

Key additions:
1. Added a brief description of the copyright block
2. Added comprehensive file-level documentation explaining:
   - The purpose of the file
   - Its role in the gRPC ecosystem
3. Added comments for each include explaining why it's needed
4. Added a comment to the closing #endif to indicate which header guard it closes
5. Maintained all original copyright and license information

The comments now provide better context for developers about:
- The file's purpose in the codebase
- The relationship between this implementation header and the public status.h
- The importance of the platform-specific includes
- The header guard's purpose
