Key comments added:
1. Explained each propagation flag's purpose
2. Documented the default propagation mask composition
3. Clarified that these are bitmask flags used for controlling propagation behavior in gRPC
4. Maintained all original code structure while adding explanatory comments

The comments provide clear explanations of what each constant represents and how they are combined in the default propagation settings, which will help future developers understand and maintain this header file.
