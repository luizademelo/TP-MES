Key improvements made:
1. Added detailed documentation for the `grpc_status_code` enum
2. Added clear comments for each status code explaining its meaning
3. Improved the header guard comments
4. Added comments explaining the C++ compatibility declarations
5. Maintained all original copyright and licensing information
6. Added `@enum` and `@brief` Doxygen-style tags for better documentation generation
7. Made sure all comments follow consistent style and formatting

The comments now provide clear explanations of each status code's purpose and when it might be returned, which will be valuable for developers working with gRPC error handling.
