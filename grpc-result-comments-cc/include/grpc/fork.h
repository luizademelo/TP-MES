The comments added:
1. Added a file-level comment explaining the purpose of the header
2. Added detailed Doxygen-style comments for each function explaining:
   - Their purpose
   - When they should be called
   - What they accomplish
3. Added a closing comment for the #endif directive to indicate what it's closing
4. Maintained all existing license and copyright information

The comments are designed to help developers understand:
- The fork handling mechanism in gRPC
- The proper sequence of operations when forking
- The difference between parent and child post-fork handling
- The recommended way to use these functions
