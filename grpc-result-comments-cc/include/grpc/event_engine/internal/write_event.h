Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2022 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPC_EVENT_ENGINE_INTERNAL_WRITE_EVENT_H
#define GRPC_EVENT_ENGINE_INTERNAL_WRITE_EVENT_H

// Namespace declaration for gRPC Event Engine experimental internal components
namespace grpc_event_engine::experimental::internal {

// Enum class representing different states/events in a write operation lifecycle
enum class WriteEvent {
  kSendMsg,    // Indicates a message is being sent
  kScheduled,  // Indicates the write operation has been scheduled
  kSent,       // Indicates the write operation has completed successfully
  kAcked,      // Indicates the write operation has been acknowledged
  kClosed,     // Indicates the write channel/connection has been closed
  kCount       // Utility value representing the total number of enum values
               // (useful for array sizing or iteration)
};

}  // namespace grpc_event_engine::experimental::internal

#endif  // GRPC_EVENT_ENGINE_INTERNAL_WRITE_EVENT_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The namespace context
3. The overall purpose of the WriteEvent enum
4. Each individual enum value's meaning
5. The special utility of the kCount value
6. The closing namespace comment
