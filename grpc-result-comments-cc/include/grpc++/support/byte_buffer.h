Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_BYTE_BUFFER_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_BYTE_BUFFER_H

// Includes the main byte buffer support header from the gRPP C++ implementation
// This provides functionality for working with binary data buffers in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/support/byte_buffer.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCXX_SUPPORT_BYTE_BUFFER_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The purpose of the header guard pattern
3. What the included header provides
4. The matching end of the header guard

The file appears to be a simple wrapper that just includes the main byte buffer implementation header while providing proper header guards. This is a common pattern in C++ libraries to organize header files while preventing multiple inclusion.
