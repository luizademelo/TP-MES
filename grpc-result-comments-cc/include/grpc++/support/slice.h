Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library and contains declarations
// for slice support functionality.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_SLICE_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_SLICE_H

// Includes the main implementation of slice support functionality
// from the gRPC C++ library
#include <grpcpp/support/slice.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic purpose of the file
2. The purpose of the header guard (a common C/C++ pattern to prevent multiple inclusions)
3. What the included header provides
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a thin wrapper that mainly serves to include the actual implementation from another header while providing proper header guards.
