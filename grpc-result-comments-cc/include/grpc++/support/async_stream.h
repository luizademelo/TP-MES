Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_ASYNC_STREAM_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_ASYNC_STREAM_H

// Includes the main implementation of asynchronous stream support for gRPC
// This provides the base functionality for asynchronous streaming RPCs
#include <grpcpp/support/async_stream.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context for future maintainers to understand the file's purpose and structure.
