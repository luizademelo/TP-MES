Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_STATUS_CODE_ENUM_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_STATUS_CODE_ENUM_H

// Includes the gRPC C++ status code enumeration definitions
// This provides the status codes used in gRPC operations
#include <grpcpp/support/status_code_enum.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard (a common C++ pattern to prevent duplicate includes)
3. The purpose of the included file (which defines gRPC status codes)
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a simple wrapper that ensures the status code enumeration header is properly included with header guard protection.
