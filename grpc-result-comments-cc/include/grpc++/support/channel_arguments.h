Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC++ support library for channel arguments.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ARGUMENTS_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ARGUMENTS_H

// Includes the main channel arguments support header from the gRPC++ implementation
// This provides the core functionality for configuring channel arguments in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/support/channel_arguments.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The header guard's purpose and mechanism
3. The included file's role in the gRPC++ implementation
4. The closing of the header guard

The comments are concise while providing context about why each part of the code exists and what it does.
