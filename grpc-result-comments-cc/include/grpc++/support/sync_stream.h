Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library and contains synchronization
// support for streaming operations.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_SYNC_STREAM_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_SYNC_STREAM_H

// Includes the main synchronization stream support header from the gRPP C++ implementation
// This provides the necessary classes and functions for synchronous streaming operations
#include <grpcpp/support/sync_stream.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and brief description of the file's purpose
2. The header guard's purpose (preventing multiple inclusions)
3. The included file's purpose and what functionality it provides
4. The closing of the header guard

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context for future maintainers to understand the file's structure and purpose.
