Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_STRING_REF_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_STRING_REF_H

// Includes the actual string_ref implementation from the gRPP C++ library
// This provides string reference functionality similar to std::string_view
#include <grpcpp/support/string_ref.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file identification
2. The purpose of the header guard pattern
3. What the included header provides (string reference functionality)
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical C++ header file structure that:
- Prevents multiple inclusions
- Declares dependencies
- Follows standard C++ header conventions
- Is part of the gRPC C++ library's support utilities
