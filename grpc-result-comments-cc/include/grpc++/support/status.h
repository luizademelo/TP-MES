Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library and contains declarations
// for status handling functionality.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_STATUS_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_STATUS_H

// Includes the main status handling implementation from the gRPC C++ library
// This provides the Status class and related functionality for error handling
// and status reporting in gRPC operations.
#include <grpcpp/support/status.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The header guard mechanism (a common C/C++ pattern to prevent duplicate includes)
3. The purpose of the included file (status.h) which contains the actual implementation
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a thin wrapper that primarily exists to maintain consistency in the include paths while providing the standard header guard protection.
