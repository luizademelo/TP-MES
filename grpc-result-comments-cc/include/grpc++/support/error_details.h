Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC++ support library.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_ERROR_DETAILS_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_ERROR_DETAILS_H

// Includes the main error details support header from the gRPC++ implementation
#include <grpcpp/support/error_details.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The purpose of the header guard (a common C++ pattern to prevent duplicate inclusions)
3. The included file which contains the actual implementation
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a fairly minimal header file that mainly serves as a wrapper/forwarding header for the actual implementation in `<grpcpp/support/error_details.h>`.
