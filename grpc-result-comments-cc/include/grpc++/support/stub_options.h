Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library and contains header guards and includes
// for stub options support in gRPC.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_STUB_OPTIONS_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_STUB_OPTIONS_H

// Includes the main stub options support header from the gRPP implementation
#include <grpcpp/support/stub_options.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the include statement is bringing in
4. The closing of the header guard

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context for future maintainers to understand the file's structure and purpose.
