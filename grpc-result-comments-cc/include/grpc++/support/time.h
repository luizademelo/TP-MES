Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library and contains time-related support functionality.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SUPPORT_TIME_H
#define GRPCXX_SUPPORT_TIME_H

// Includes the main time support header from the gRPC C++ implementation
// This provides time-related utilities and abstractions for gRPC operations
#include <grpcpp/support/time.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and brief file purpose
2. The header guard mechanism (standard C++ practice to prevent multiple inclusions)
3. The purpose of the included header file
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a simple wrapper that ensures the main time support functionality from gRPC's C++ implementation is properly included with header guard protection.
