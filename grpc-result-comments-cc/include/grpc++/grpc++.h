Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC++ library.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_GRPCXX_H
#define GRPCXX_GRPCXX_H

// Main include file for the gRPC C++ library
// This provides all the core gRPC functionality for C++ developers
#include <grpcpp/grpcpp.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the file
3. The header guard mechanism (both opening and closing)
4. The significance of the main include file

This maintains the original functionality while making the code's purpose and structure clearer to future maintainers.
