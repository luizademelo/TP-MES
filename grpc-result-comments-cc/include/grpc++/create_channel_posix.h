Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This header file is part of the gRPC++ library and provides POSIX-specific
// channel creation functionality.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_CREATE_CHANNEL_POSIX_H
#define GRPCXX_CREATE_CHANNEL_POSIX_H

// Includes the implementation of POSIX-specific channel creation functionality
#include <grpcpp/create_channel_posix.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and brief description of the file's purpose
2. The purpose of the header guard (a common C++ pattern to prevent multiple inclusions)
3. What the included header provides
4. The closing of the header guard

The comments are kept concise while providing all the essential information about this boilerplate header file.
