Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_RESOURCE_QUOTA_H
#define GRPCXX_RESOURCE_QUOTA_H

// Includes the main resource quota implementation from the gRPC++ library
// This provides functionality for managing resource allocation limits in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/resource_quota.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (standard practice in C/C++ headers)
2. What the included file provides (resource quota management functionality)
3. The closing of the header guard

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context about the file's purpose and structure.
