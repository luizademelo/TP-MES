Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC++ library and contains header guards and includes
// for the channel functionality.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_CHANNEL_H
#define GRPCXX_CHANNEL_H

// Include the main channel implementation header from the gRPC++ library
// This provides the core channel functionality for gRPC communications
#include <grpcpp/channel.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the file
3. The header guard mechanism
4. The significance of the included header
5. The closing of the header guard

This documentation helps future developers understand:
- That this is a wrapper/forwarding header
- The purpose of each part of the file
- Where the actual implementation is located
- That proper include guards are in place
