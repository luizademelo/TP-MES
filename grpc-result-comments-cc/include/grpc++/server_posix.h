Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library and contains POSIX-specific
// server functionality.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SERVER_POSIX_H
#define GRPCXX_SERVER_POSIX_H

// Includes the main implementation of POSIX-specific server functionality
// for gRPC C++ server. This is the actual implementation file that contains
// the POSIX-specific server features.
#include <grpcpp/server_posix.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and brief description of the file's purpose
2. The header guard mechanism and its purpose
3. The included file and what it provides
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical C++ header file structure that:
- Protects against multiple inclusions
- Provides necessary functionality through an included implementation
- Maintains clean organization with header guards
