Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library and contains interfaces for health check services.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_HEALTH_CHECK_SERVICE_INTERFACE_H
#define GRPCXX_HEALTH_CHECK_SERVICE_INTERFACE_H

// Include the main health check service interface implementation from gRPP
#include <grpcpp/health_check_service_interface.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and brief description of the file's purpose
2. The header guard's purpose (preventing multiple inclusions)
3. What is being included from the gRPC library
4. The closing of the header guard

This maintains the original functionality while making the code's purpose and structure clearer to future maintainers.
