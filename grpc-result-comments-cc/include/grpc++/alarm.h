Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC++ library and contains header guards and includes
// for the Alarm functionality in gRPC.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_ALARM_H
#define GRPCXX_ALARM_H

// Include the main gRPC++ Alarm implementation header
// This provides the Alarm class and related functionality for setting timers
// that trigger callbacks in gRPC's completion queue system
#include <grpcpp/alarm.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The header guard mechanism (standard C++ practice to prevent duplicate includes)
3. The purpose of the included header (gRPC's Alarm functionality)
4. The closing of the header guard

The Alarm class in gRPC is typically used for setting timeouts or scheduling future actions in the gRPC completion queue system.
