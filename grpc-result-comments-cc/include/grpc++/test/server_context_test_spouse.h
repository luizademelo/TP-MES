Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright notice indicating the original authors and year of creation
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_TEST_SERVER_CONTEXT_TEST_SPOUSE_H
#define GRPCXX_TEST_SERVER_CONTEXT_TEST_SPOUSE_H

// Include the actual implementation file that contains the test utilities
// for gRPC server context testing
#include <grpcpp/test/server_context_test_spouse.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The actual include statement which pulls in the test utilities
4. The closing of the header guard

This appears to be a wrapper header file that primarily serves to include the actual implementation while providing proper header guards and copyright information.
