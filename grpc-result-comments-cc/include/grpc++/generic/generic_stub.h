Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library for C++.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_GENERIC_GENERIC_STUB_H
#define GRPCXX_GENERIC_GENERIC_STUB_H

// Includes the implementation of the generic stub functionality
// This provides the base class for gRPC stubs that can handle arbitrary RPC methods
#include <grpcpp/generic/generic_stub.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

These comments help future developers understand:
- The file's ownership and context
- Why the header guard pattern is used
- What functionality this header provides through its inclusion
- The structure of the header file
