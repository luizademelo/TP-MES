Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library's generic async service components.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_GENERIC_ASYNC_GENERIC_SERVICE_H
#define GRPCXX_GENERIC_ASYNC_GENERIC_SERVICE_H

// Includes the main implementation file for the asynchronous generic service
// This provides the base functionality for handling generic RPC calls
#include <grpcpp/generic/async_generic_service.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCXX_GENERIC_ASYNC_GENERIC_SERVICE_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The significance of the included file
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a wrapper header that primarily serves to include the main implementation while providing proper header guards. This is a common pattern in C++ libraries to organize includes and prevent multiple inclusion.
