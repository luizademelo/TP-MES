Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SECURITY_AUTH_METADATA_PROCESSOR_H
#define GRPCXX_SECURITY_AUTH_METADATA_PROCESSOR_H

// Includes the main implementation of the auth metadata processor functionality
// from the gRPC++ security components
#include <grpcpp/security/auth_metadata_processor.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard pattern (#ifndef/#define)
3. What the included header file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical C++ header file structure that:
- Prevents multiple inclusions
- Declares dependencies
- Maintains clean header file organization
The actual authentication metadata processing functionality would be implemented in the included file.
