Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library's security components.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SECURITY_AUTH_CONTEXT_H
#define GRPCXX_SECURITY_AUTH_CONTEXT_H

// Includes the main auth_context.h header from the gRPC C++ security implementation
// This provides the authentication context functionality for gRPC
#include <grpcpp/security/auth_context.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The purpose of the header guard (a standard C++ practice to prevent multiple inclusions)
3. The included file and its significance
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a relatively simple header file that primarily serves as an include wrapper with proper header guards, which is a common pattern in C++ libraries.
