Here's the commented version of the code:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC++ library and contains header guards and includes
// for channel creation functionality.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_CREATE_CHANNEL_H
#define GRPCXX_CREATE_CHANNEL_H

// Include the main implementation file for creating gRPC channels
// This provides all the necessary functionality for channel creation
#include <grpcpp/create_channel.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and brief description of the file's purpose
2. The header guard mechanism to prevent multiple inclusions
3. The purpose of the included file
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a relatively simple header file that primarily serves as a wrapper/forwarding header for the actual implementation in `<grpcpp/create_channel.h>`. The comments help future maintainers understand its structure and purpose.
