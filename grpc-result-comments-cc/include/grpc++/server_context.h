Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC++ library and contains declarations for server context functionality.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_SERVER_CONTEXT_H
#define GRPCXX_SERVER_CONTEXT_H

// Includes the main server context implementation from the gRPP C++ library
// This provides the ServerContext class which holds server-side call context information
// including metadata, deadlines, cancellation, etc.
#include <grpcpp/server_context.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and brief file purpose
2. The header guard mechanism (standard C++ practice to prevent duplicate includes)
3. The included header file and its significance (ServerContext class functionality)
4. The closing of the header guard

The comments provide context about both the technical aspects (header guards) and the functional purpose of the included file.
