// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_SERIALIZATION_TRAITS_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_SERIALIZATION_TRAITS_H

// Includes the main serialization traits header from the gRPP C++ library
// This provides the core functionality for serialization/deserialization
// of data types in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/impl/serialization_traits.h>
