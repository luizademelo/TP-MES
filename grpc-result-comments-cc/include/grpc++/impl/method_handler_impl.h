Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H

// Includes the main implementation file for gRPC method handlers
// This contains the core functionality for handling RPC methods in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/impl/method_handler_impl.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file contains
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a simple wrapper header that mainly serves to:
- Establish the header guard
- Include the main implementation file
This is a common pattern in C++ libraries to provide a clean include path while keeping the actual implementation in a separate file.
