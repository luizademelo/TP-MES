Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_SERVER_INITIALIZER_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_SERVER_INITIALIZER_H

// Includes the main server initializer implementation header from gRPP
// This provides the core functionality for initializing gRPC servers
#include <grpcpp/impl/server_initializer.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The significance of the included file
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a relatively simple header file that primarily serves to:
- Establish the header guard
- Include the main implementation file
The comments help future developers understand the basic structure and purpose of this file, even though it's quite minimal in functionality.
