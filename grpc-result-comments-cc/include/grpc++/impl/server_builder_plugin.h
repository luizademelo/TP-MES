Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_SERVER_BUILDER_PLUGIN_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_SERVER_BUILDER_PLUGIN_H

// Includes the main server builder plugin interface definitions
// This provides the base functionality for server builder plugins in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/impl/server_builder_plugin.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard pattern
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

This maintains the original functionality while making the code's purpose clearer to future maintainers. The comments are concise but provide enough context about why each part exists.
