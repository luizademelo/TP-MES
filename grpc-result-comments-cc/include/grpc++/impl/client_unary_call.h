Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CLIENT_UNARY_CALL_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CLIENT_UNARY_CALL_H

// Includes the main implementation file for client unary call functionality
// This provides the core implementation for making unary RPC calls from clients
#include <grpcpp/impl/client_unary_call.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The significance of the included file
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a thin wrapper that primarily serves to include the main implementation file while providing proper header guards. This is a common pattern in C++ libraries to organize code while preventing multiple inclusion issues.
