Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_SERVICE_TYPE_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_SERVICE_TYPE_H

// Includes the main service type implementation header from the gRPP C++ library
// This provides the core service type definitions and functionality
#include <grpcpp/impl/service_type.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The significance of the included file
4. The closing of the header guard

This documentation helps future developers understand:
- The file's ownership and context
- Why the header guard pattern is used
- What functionality is being imported
- The structure of the include protection
