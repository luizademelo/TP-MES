Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_SERVER_BUILDER_OPTION_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_SERVER_BUILDER_OPTION_H

// Includes the main implementation file for ServerBuilder options
// This is a common pattern where the public header just includes
// the actual implementation header
#include <grpcpp/impl/server_builder_option.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (a standard C++ practice)
2. The inclusion pattern being used (where this header just includes the implementation header)
3. The closing of the header guard

This is a fairly minimal header file that follows the common pattern of having a public-facing header that simply includes the implementation header. The comments help future maintainers understand this pattern and the file's purpose.
