Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC++ implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_GRPC_LIBRARY_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_GRPC_LIBRARY_H

// Includes the main gRPC++ library implementation header
// This provides the core functionality for gRPC C++ library initialization
// and management
#include <grpcpp/impl/grpc_library.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included header provides
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a relatively simple header file that primarily serves as an include wrapper with proper header guards. The main functionality would be in the included `grpc_library.h` file.
