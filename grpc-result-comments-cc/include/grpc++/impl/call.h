Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CALL_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CALL_H

// Includes the main implementation of the gRPC call functionality
// This provides the core call interface for gRPC C++ operations
#include <grpcpp/impl/call.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CALL_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard pattern
3. The significance of the included file
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical header file structure in C++ that:
- Protects against multiple inclusions
- Provides necessary declarations/includes
- Maintains clean header file organization
