Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This header file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CONFIG_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CONFIG_H

// Includes the main configuration header for gRPC C++ implementation
// This is the actual file that contains all configuration definitions
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/config.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the file in the gRPC ecosystem
3. The header guard pattern used to prevent multiple inclusions
4. The purpose of the include directive
5. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical configuration forwarding header that ensures consistent configuration across the codebase by including the canonical configuration file.
