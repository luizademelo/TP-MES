Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_H

// Includes the main status header file from the gRPC C++ implementation
// This provides the status-related functionality and definitions
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/status.h>

#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The significance of the included file
4. The closing of the header guard with a matching comment for clarity

The file appears to be a wrapper header that simply includes the main status implementation header while providing proper header guards. This is a common pattern in library implementations to provide a clean include path while maintaining proper inclusion protection.
