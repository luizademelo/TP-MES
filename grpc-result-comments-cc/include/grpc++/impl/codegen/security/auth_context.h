Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SECURITY_AUTH_CONTEXT_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SECURITY_AUTH_CONTEXT_H

// Includes the main implementation of the authentication context functionality
// from the gRPC C++ library. This provides classes and methods for handling
// security authentication contexts in gRPC communications.
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/security/auth_context.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file purpose
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included header provides
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a relatively simple header file that mainly serves to include the actual implementation header while providing proper include guards. The comments help future developers understand its purpose and structure.
