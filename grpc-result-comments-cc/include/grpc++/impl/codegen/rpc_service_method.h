Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_RPC_SERVICE_METHOD_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_RPC_SERVICE_METHOD_H

// Includes the main implementation file for RPC service method functionality
// This is part of gRPC's C++ codegen (code generation) infrastructure
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/rpc_service_method.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_RPC_SERVICE_METHOD_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The significance of the included file
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical C++ header file structure that:
- Protects against multiple inclusions
- Includes necessary implementation
- Maintains clean header file organization
