Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVICE_TYPE_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVICE_TYPE_H

// Includes the main service type implementation from the public header
// This is part of the internal implementation details of gRPC C++
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/service_type.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the file in the gRPC ecosystem
3. The header guard mechanism
4. The included file and its significance
5. The closing of the header guard

This style of commenting follows common C++ practices while providing clear context about the file's purpose and structure.
