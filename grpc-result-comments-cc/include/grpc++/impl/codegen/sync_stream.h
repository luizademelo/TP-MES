Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SYNC_STREAM_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SYNC_STREAM_H

// Includes the actual implementation of synchronous streaming functionality
// This is a forwarding header that points to the real implementation location
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/sync_stream.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the file in the gRPC ecosystem
3. The header guard's purpose
4. The nature of the include (as a forwarding header)
5. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical C++ header file structure that:
- Protects against multiple inclusions
- Forwards to the actual implementation
- Maintains clean header organization
