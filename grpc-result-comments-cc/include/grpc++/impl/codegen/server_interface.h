Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This header file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_INTERFACE_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_INTERFACE_H

// Includes the main implementation of the server interface from the gRPP C++ library
// This is a forward declaration or facade pattern where this header serves as an
// indirection point to the actual implementation
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/server_interface.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the file in the gRPC ecosystem
3. The header guard pattern and its purpose
4. The purpose of the include statement and its relationship to the actual implementation
5. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a facade or forwarding header that provides an indirection point to the actual server interface implementation in the gRPC C++ library.
