Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STUB_OPTIONS_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STUB_OPTIONS_H

// Includes the main stub options implementation file from the gRPP C++ library
// This is a common pattern in C++ libraries where the public header just includes
// the actual implementation header from an internal/impl/codegen directory
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/stub_options.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The inclusion pattern being used (common in library development)
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical wrapper header file that serves as the public interface while including the actual implementation from an internal location. The pattern helps maintain separation between public API and implementation details.
