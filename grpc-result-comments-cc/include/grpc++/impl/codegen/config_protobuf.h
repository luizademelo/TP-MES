Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CONFIG_PROTOBUF_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CONFIG_PROTOBUF_H

// Includes the main configuration header for Protobuf in gRPC C++.
// This file likely contains necessary definitions and configurations
// for Protocol Buffers integration with gRPC.
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/config_protobuf.h>

#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CONFIG_PROTOBUF_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. What the included file likely contains
3. The closing comment for the header guard (improved with the guard name)

The code appears to be a simple wrapper header that ensures proper inclusion of gRPC's Protobuf configuration while preventing multiple inclusions through the header guard pattern.
