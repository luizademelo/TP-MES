Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_PROTO_UTILS_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_PROTO_UTILS_H

// Includes the main implementation of Protocol Buffer utilities for gRPC
// This provides core functionality for Protocol Buffer serialization/deserialization
// and other Proto-related operations used by gRPC
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/proto_utils.h>

#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_PROTO_UTILS_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard with a matching comment

The code appears to be a simple wrapper header that includes the main implementation of Protocol Buffer utilities for gRPC's C++ implementation. This is a common pattern in library design where implementation details are separated from the public interface.
