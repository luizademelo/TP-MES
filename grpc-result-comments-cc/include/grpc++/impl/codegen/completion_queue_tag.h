Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_COMPLETION_QUEUE_TAG_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_COMPLETION_QUEUE_TAG_H

// Includes the main implementation file for CompletionQueueTag functionality.
// This is part of gRPC's internal codegen system that helps generate
// boilerplate code for asynchronous operations.
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/completion_queue_tag.h>

#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_COMPLETION_QUEUE_TAG_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard with a matching comment

The code appears to be a forwarding header that includes the actual implementation file for CompletionQueueTag functionality in gRPC's C++ implementation.
