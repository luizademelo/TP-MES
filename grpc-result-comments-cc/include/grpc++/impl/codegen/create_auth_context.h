Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CREATE_AUTH_CONTEXT_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CREATE_AUTH_CONTEXT_H

// Includes the main implementation file for creating authentication contexts
// This is part of gRPC's code generation infrastructure for security features
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/create_auth_context.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the file in the gRPC ecosystem
3. The header guard mechanism
4. The included file's purpose
5. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a thin wrapper that mainly serves to provide header guards around the actual implementation file. This is a common pattern in C++ libraries to prevent multiple inclusion and organize code structure.
