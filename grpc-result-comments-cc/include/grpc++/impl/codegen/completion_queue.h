Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_COMPLETION_QUEUE_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_COMPLETION_QUEUE_H

// Includes the main implementation file for the Completion Queue functionality
// in gRPC. The completion queue is a fundamental construct in gRPC used for
// managing asynchronous operations and their associated events.
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/completion_queue.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The significance of the included file and completion queues in gRPC
4. The closing of the header guard

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context for future maintainers to understand the file's purpose and structure.
