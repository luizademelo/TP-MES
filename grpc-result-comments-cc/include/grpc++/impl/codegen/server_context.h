Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_CONTEXT_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_CONTEXT_H

// Includes the main implementation of the ServerContext class which provides
// server-side context information for RPC calls, including request metadata,
// cancellation, deadlines, and other call properties.
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/server_context.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file purpose
2. The header guard's purpose
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

The code appears to be a forwarding header that ensures the main server context implementation is included while providing proper header guards.
