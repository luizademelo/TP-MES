Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERIALIZATION_TRAITS_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERIALIZATION_TRAITS_H

// Includes the main implementation of serialization traits for gRPC
// This provides type traits and utilities for serializing/deserializing data
// in gRPC communications
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/serialization_traits.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides (serialization traits functionality)
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a thin wrapper that mainly exists to provide the header guard and include the actual implementation file. This is a common pattern in C++ libraries to manage includes and prevent circular dependencies.
