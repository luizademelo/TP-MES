Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_HOOK_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_HOOK_H

// Includes the main implementation file for call hooks functionality
// This is a common pattern in gRPC's codebase where the public header
// includes the actual implementation from the codegen directory
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/call_hook.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_HOOK_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The inclusion pattern used in gRPC's codebase
4. The closing of the header guard

Note that there appears to be a typo in the original code (`call_hook.h` vs `call_hook.h` in the include statement), but I've preserved it as in the original. In a real codebase, this should likely be consistent.
