Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_ASYNC_UNARY_CALL_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_ASYNC_UNARY_CALL_H

// Includes the implementation of asynchronous unary call functionality
// This is the main header file that contains the actual implementation
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/async_unary_call.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file description
2. The purpose of the header guard (a common C++ pattern to prevent duplicate includes)
3. What the included header file provides (async unary call implementation)
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical C++ header file structure that serves as a facade or indirection point for the actual implementation file. The comments help future maintainers understand the purpose of each part of this boilerplate code.
