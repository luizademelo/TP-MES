Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_CODE_ENUM_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_CODE_ENUM_H

// Includes the actual status code enumeration definitions from the gRPC implementation
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/status_code_enum.h>

#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_CODE_ENUM_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard (a common C++ pattern to prevent duplicate includes)
3. What the included file contains (status code enum definitions)
4. The closing of the header guard with a comment indicating which guard it's closing

I've kept the original structure while adding explanatory comments that would help maintainers understand the purpose of each part of this header file.
