Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_H

// Includes the main implementation of the gRPC call interface
// This is the actual implementation file that contains the call functionality
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/call.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard pattern
3. What the included file contains
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical C++ header file structure that:
- Protects against multiple inclusions
- Provides the necessary declarations/includes
- Follows standard C++ header conventions
