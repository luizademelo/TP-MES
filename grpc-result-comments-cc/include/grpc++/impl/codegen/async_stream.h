Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_ASYNC_STREAM_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_ASYNC_STREAM_H

// Includes the actual implementation of asynchronous streams
// This is a forwarding header that points to the real implementation
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/async_stream.h>

#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_ASYNC_STREAM_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The nature of this file as a forwarding header to the actual implementation
4. The closing of the header guard with a comment indicating which guard it's closing

This style of commenting follows common C++ header file documentation practices while keeping the comments concise and relevant.
