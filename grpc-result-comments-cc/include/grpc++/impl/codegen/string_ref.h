Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STRING_REF_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STRING_REF_H

// Includes the actual string_ref implementation from the gRPC codebase
// This is a common pattern where the public header just includes the
// implementation header from the codegen directory
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/string_ref.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_STRING_REF_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file description
2. The purpose of the header guard pattern
3. The inclusion pattern being used (forwarding to the implementation header)
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical structure for a public-facing header file in a library that separates interface from implementation. The actual functionality is implemented in the included file from the codegen directory.
