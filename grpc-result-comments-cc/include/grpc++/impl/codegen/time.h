Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This header file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_TIME_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_TIME_H

// Includes the main time-related functionality implementation for gRPC C++
// This is a forwarding header that ensures consistent time functionality
// across the codebase
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/time.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the file in the gRPC ecosystem
3. The header guard mechanism
4. The purpose of the include statement
5. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical forwarding header file in C++ libraries that serves to:
- Provide a single inclusion point for time-related functionality
- Maintain consistency across the codebase
- Allow for potential future implementation changes without affecting client code
