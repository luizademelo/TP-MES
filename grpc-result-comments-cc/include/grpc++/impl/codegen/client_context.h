Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CLIENT_CONTEXT_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CLIENT_CONTEXT_H

// Includes the main client context implementation from the gRPP library
// This provides the core functionality for client-side context management in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/client_context.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical C++ header file structure with:
- Copyright notice
- Include guard pattern (#ifndef/#define/#endif)
- A single include directive for the actual implementation
