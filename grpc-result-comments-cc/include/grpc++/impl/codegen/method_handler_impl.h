Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H

// Includes the main implementation file for gRPC method handlers
// This provides the core functionality for handling RPC methods in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/method_handler_impl.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file description
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a minimal header file that primarily serves as an include wrapper with proper header guards, which is a common pattern in C++ libraries to organize code and prevent multiple inclusions.
