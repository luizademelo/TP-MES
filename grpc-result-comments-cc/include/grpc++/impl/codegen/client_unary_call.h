Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CLIENT_UNARY_CALL_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CLIENT_UNARY_CALL_H

// Includes the implementation of client unary call functionality
// This provides the core functionality for making unary RPC calls from a client
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/client_unary_call.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a wrapper header that primarily serves to include the actual implementation while providing proper header guards to prevent multiple inclusions.
