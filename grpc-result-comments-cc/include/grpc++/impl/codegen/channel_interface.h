Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CHANNEL_INTERFACE_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CHANNEL_INTERFACE_H

// Includes the main channel interface implementation from the gRPP public headers
// This serves as a forwarding header to maintain compatibility and organization
#include <grpcpp/impl/codegen/channel_interface.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_CODEGEN_CHANNEL_INTERFACE_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The header guard's purpose
3. The include statement's role as a forwarding header
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical forwarding header file in C++ that:
- Prevents multiple inclusions
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Centralizes the include path for the channel interface implementation
- Follows standard C++ header file conventions
