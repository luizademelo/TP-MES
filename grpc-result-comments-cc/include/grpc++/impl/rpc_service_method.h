Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_RPC_SERVICE_METHOD_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_RPC_SERVICE_METHOD_H

// Includes the implementation of RPC service methods for gRPC C++
// This provides the core functionality for handling RPC methods in services
#include <grpcpp/impl/rpc_service_method.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCXX_IMPL_RPC_SERVICE_METHOD_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a relatively simple header file that mainly serves as an include wrapper with proper header guards. The significant functionality comes from the included `rpc_service_method.h` file.
