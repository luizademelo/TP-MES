Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC C++ library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCXX_IMPL_CHANNEL_ARGUMENT_OPTION_H
#define GRPCXX_IMPL_CHANNEL_ARGUMENT_OPTION_H

// Includes the implementation of channel argument options for gRPC C++
// This provides functionality to set various channel arguments when creating gRPC channels
#include <grpcpp/impl/channel_argument_option.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a relatively simple header file that primarily serves as an include wrapper with protection against multiple inclusions. The actual functionality is implemented in the included file.
