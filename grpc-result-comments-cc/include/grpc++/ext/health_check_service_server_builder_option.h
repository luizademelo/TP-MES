#ifndef GRPCXX_EXT_HEALTH_CHECK_SERVICE_SERVER_BUILDER_OPTION_H
#define GRPCXX_EXT_HEALTH_CHECK_SERVICE_SERVER_BUILDER_OPTION_H

// Includes the implementation of the health check service server builder option
// This provides the functionality to add health check services to gRPC servers
#include <grpcpp/ext/health_check_service_server_builder_option.h>

#endif  // GRPCXX_EXT_HEALTH_CHECK_SERVICE_SERVER_BUILDER_OPTION_H
```
