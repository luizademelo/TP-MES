Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CREATE_AUTH_CONTEXT_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CREATE_AUTH_CONTEXT_H

// Includes the actual implementation of the authentication context creation functionality
// This follows the Pimpl (Pointer to implementation) idiom where the implementation
// details are separated from the interface
#include <grpcpp/impl/create_auth_context.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The include statement's role in the code structure
3. The design pattern being used (Pimpl idiom)
4. The closing of the header guard

The comments are kept concise while providing meaningful context about the code's structure and design decisions.
