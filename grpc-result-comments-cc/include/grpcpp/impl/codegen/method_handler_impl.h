Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.
// It contains header guards to prevent multiple inclusions of this file.

// Header guard macro to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
// GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H is a unique identifier for this header
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H

// The actual content of this header would typically go here
// (between the #define and #endif directives)

#endif  // GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file purpose
2. The purpose of header guards in C/C++
3. The specific header guard macro being used
4. Where the actual header content would normally appear
5. The matching endif with the macro name for clarity

The comments are kept concise while providing all the essential information about this boilerplate header file structure.
