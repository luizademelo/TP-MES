Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_INTERCEPTOR_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_INTERCEPTOR_H

// Includes the main server interceptor support functionality
// This provides the base classes and utilities needed for implementing
// server-side interceptors in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/support/server_interceptor.h>

#endif  // GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_INTERCEPTOR_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file description
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included header provides (server interceptor functionality)
4. The closing of the header guard with a comment for clarity

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context for future maintainers to understand the purpose and structure of this header file.
