Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CLIENT_CONTEXT_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CLIENT_CONTEXT_H

// Includes the main client context header from the gRPC++ library
// This provides the core functionality for client-side context handling in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/client_context.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (standard C++ practice to prevent multiple inclusions)
2. The significance of including the main client_context.h header
3. The closing of the header guard

This is a relatively simple header file that primarily serves to include the main client context implementation while providing proper include guards. The actual client context functionality would be defined in the included grpcpp/client_context.h file.
