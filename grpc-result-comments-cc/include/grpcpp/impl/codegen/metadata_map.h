Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_METADATA_MAP_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_METADATA_MAP_H

// Includes the actual implementation of metadata map functionality
// This is a forwarding header that points to the real implementation
#include <grpcpp/impl/metadata_map.h>

#endif  // GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_METADATA_MAP_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The nature of this file as a forwarding header
3. The actual location of the implementation
4. The closing of the header guard with a descriptive comment

This style of commenting follows best practices by:
- Being concise yet informative
- Explaining the why, not just the what
- Including meaningful end-of-block comments
- Maintaining consistency with common C++ header file patterns
