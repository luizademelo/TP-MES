Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_H

// Includes the main implementation file for gRPC call functionality
// This is the actual implementation that will be included when this header is used
#include <grpcpp/impl/call.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and basic file description
2. The purpose of the header guard (a common C++ pattern to prevent duplicate includes)
3. The significance of the included file (the actual implementation)
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical header file structure in C++ projects, particularly in library implementations like gRPC. The comments help future developers understand:
- The file's purpose (a wrapper/include point for call functionality)
- The standard C++ include protection mechanism
- Where the actual implementation resides
