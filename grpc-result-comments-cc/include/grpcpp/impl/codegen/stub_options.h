Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_STUB_OPTIONS_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_STUB_OPTIONS_H

// Includes the main stub options support header from the gRPC++ support library
// This provides the necessary declarations and definitions for stub options
#include <grpcpp/support/stub_options.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (standard C++ practice to prevent multiple inclusions)
2. The inclusion of the main stub options header file from gRPC's support library
3. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical C++ header file structure with include guards and a single include directive. The actual functionality is implemented in the included file.
