Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2019 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_CALLBACK_HANDLERS_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_CALLBACK_HANDLERS_H

// Includes the implementation of server callback handlers for gRPC.
// This provides the necessary functionality for handling server-side
// callbacks in gRPC applications.
#include <grpcpp/impl/server_callback_handlers.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (to prevent multiple inclusions)
2. What the included file provides (server callback handlers implementation for gRPC)
3. The end of the header guard section

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context about the file's purpose and structure.
