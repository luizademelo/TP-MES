Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library and contains interceptor-related functionality.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_INTERCEPTOR_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_INTERCEPTOR_H

// Includes the main interceptor support header which contains the core interceptor functionality
#include <grpcpp/support/interceptor.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and brief description of the file's purpose
2. The purpose of the header guard (a common C++ pattern to prevent multiple inclusions)
3. The included header file and its purpose
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a simple wrapper header that primarily serves to include the main interceptor support header while providing proper header guards.
