Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_ASYNC_UNARY_CALL_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_ASYNC_UNARY_CALL_H

// Includes the main async unary call support header which contains
// the actual implementation of asynchronous unary call functionality.
// This file serves as a forwarding header to maintain backward compatibility
// and proper code organization.
#include <grpcpp/support/async_unary_call.h>

#endif  // GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_ASYNC_UNARY_CALL_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The role of this file as a forwarding header
3. The relationship with the main implementation header
4. The closing comment for the header guard (improved with the filename)
