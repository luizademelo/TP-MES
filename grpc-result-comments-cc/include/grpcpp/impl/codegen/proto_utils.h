Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_PROTO_UTILS_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_PROTO_UTILS_H

// Includes the main implementation of protobuf utilities for gRPC
// This provides core functionality for protocol buffer serialization/deserialization
// and other proto-related operations in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/impl/proto_utils.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. What the included file provides
3. The closing of the header guard

I've kept the original copyright notice at the top as it's important to maintain attribution. The comments are concise but provide enough context for developers to understand the purpose of each part of this header file.
