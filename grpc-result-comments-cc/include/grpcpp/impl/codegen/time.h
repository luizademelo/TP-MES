Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_TIME_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_TIME_H

// Includes the main time support header from gRPC's C++ interface
// This provides time-related functionality for gRPC operations
#include <grpcpp/support/time.h>

#endif  // End of header guard GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_TIME_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (a standard C++ practice to prevent multiple inclusions)
2. The significance of the included header file (which contains time-related functionality for gRPC)
3. The closing of the header guard with a clarifying comment

The comments are kept concise while providing all the essential information a developer would need to understand this header file's purpose and structure.
