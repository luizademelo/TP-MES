Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_OP_SET_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_OP_SET_H

// Includes the main implementation of CallOpSet interface
// This provides the core functionality for gRPC call operations
#include <grpcpp/impl/call_op_set.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file provides
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a relatively simple header file that primarily serves as an include wrapper with proper header guards. The actual implementation would be in the included `call_op_set.h` file.
