Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015-2016 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_COMPLETION_QUEUE_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_COMPLETION_QUEUE_H

// Includes the main completion queue header file from the gRPC++ library
// This provides the core CompletionQueue functionality for gRPC operations
#include <grpcpp/completion_queue.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the copyright notice
2. The header guard mechanism and its purpose
3. The significance of the included file
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical header file structure in C++ that:
- Protects against multiple inclusions
- Serves as a forwarding header for the actual implementation
- Maintains backward compatibility with code that might include this path directly
