Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library and contains common callback functionality.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALLBACK_COMMON_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALLBACK_COMMON_H

// Includes the public callback support header from the gRPC++ support library
// This provides common callback functionality used throughout gRPC
#include <grpcpp/support/callback_common.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and brief description of the file's purpose
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The significance of the included header file
4. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a forwarding header that simply includes the public callback support header from gRPC's support library, likely to maintain a consistent include path structure in the codebase.
