Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2016 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_H

// Includes the main Status support header from the gRPC C++ library
// This provides the core status/error handling functionality for gRPC operations
#include <grpcpp/support/status.h>

#endif  // End of header guard GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_STATUS_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. What the included header provides
3. The closing of the header guard with a descriptive end comment

The code appears to be a simple wrapper header that ensures the main status.h header is included while preventing multiple inclusions through the header guard pattern. This is a common pattern in C++ libraries to organize header files while maintaining proper inclusion mechanics.
