Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_RPC_METHOD_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_RPC_METHOD_H

// Includes the actual implementation of RPC methods from the public interface
// This is part of the gRPC C++ library's internal code generation infrastructure
#include <grpcpp/impl/rpc_method.h>

#endif  // GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_RPC_METHOD_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The nature of the include (that it's part of gRPC's internal infrastructure)
3. What the included file contains
4. The closing of the header guard with a descriptive comment

The comments are kept concise while providing meaningful context about this infrastructure-related header file.
