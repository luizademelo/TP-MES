Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERIALIZATION_TRAITS_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERIALIZATION_TRAITS_H

// Includes the main serialization traits header file from the gRPC C++ implementation
// This provides the core serialization functionality for gRPC messages
#include <grpcpp/impl/serialization_traits.h>

#endif  // End of header guard GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERIALIZATION_TRAITS_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. What the included file provides
3. The closing of the header guard with a note about what it's closing

I've kept the original copyright notice at the top as it's important to maintain attribution. The comments are concise but provide enough context for developers to understand the purpose of each part of this header file.
