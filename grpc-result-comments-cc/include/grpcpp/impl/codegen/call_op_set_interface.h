Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_OP_SET_INTERFACE_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_OP_SET_INTERFACE_H

// Includes the declaration of the CallOpSetInterface class which defines
// the interface for call operation sets in gRPC. This interface is used
// to manage various operations (like sending/receiving messages, metadata, etc.)
// that can be performed during an RPC call.
#include <grpcpp/impl/call_op_set_interface.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_OP_SET_INTERFACE_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included header file contains and its role in the gRPC system
4. The closing of the header guard

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context about the file's purpose and structure.
