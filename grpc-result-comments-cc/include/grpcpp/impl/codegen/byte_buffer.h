Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2017 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_BYTE_BUFFER_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_BYTE_BUFFER_H

// Includes the main byte buffer support header from gRPC's C++ interface
// This provides the core functionality for working with byte buffers in gRPC
#include <grpcpp/support/byte_buffer.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice at the top
2. The purpose of the header guard pattern (#ifndef/#define) to prevent multiple inclusions
3. The significance of including the main byte buffer support header
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical header file structure in C++ projects, particularly in gRPC's implementation, where it serves as a forwarding header to the actual implementation.
