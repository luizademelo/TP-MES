Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2016 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_RPC_SERVICE_METHOD_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_RPC_SERVICE_METHOD_H

// Includes the actual implementation of RPC service methods
// This appears to be a forwarding header that points to the real implementation
#include <grpcpp/impl/rpc_service_method.h>

#endif  // GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_RPC_SERVICE_METHOD_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The nature of this file as a forwarding header
4. The closing of the header guard with a descriptive comment

The file appears to be a simple forwarding header that includes the actual implementation while maintaining backward compatibility with the old include path.
