Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2019 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_CONTEXT_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_CONTEXT_H

// Includes the main server context header from the gRPP C++ implementation
// This provides the core ServerContext functionality for gRPC servers
#include <grpcpp/server_context.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the copyright notice
2. The header guard pattern used to prevent duplicate inclusions
3. The significance of including the main server context header
4. The closing of the header guard

The code appears to be a forwarding header that primarily exists to maintain compatibility and include the main server context implementation.
