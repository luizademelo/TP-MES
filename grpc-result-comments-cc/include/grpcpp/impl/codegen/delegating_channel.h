Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2019 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_DELEGATING_CHANNEL_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_DELEGATING_CHANNEL_H

// Includes the implementation of the delegating channel functionality
// The delegating channel is a wrapper channel that forwards calls to another channel
#include <grpcpp/impl/delegating_channel.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. What the included file contains
3. The basic concept of a delegating channel
4. The closing of the header guard

This provides context for developers who might be unfamiliar with this specific part of the gRPC codebase.
