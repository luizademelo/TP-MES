Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2016 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CHANNEL_INTERFACE_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CHANNEL_INTERFACE_H

// Includes the actual implementation of the channel interface
// This is a common pattern where a codegen header includes the real implementation
#include <grpcpp/impl/channel_interface.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (a standard C++ practice to prevent multiple inclusions)
2. The inclusion pattern being used (where this appears to be a forwarding header that includes the actual implementation)
3. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical header file structure in C++ projects, particularly in gRPC's codebase where there's often a separation between codegen (code generation) headers and implementation headers.
