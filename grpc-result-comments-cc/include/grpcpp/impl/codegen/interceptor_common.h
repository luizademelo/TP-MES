Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_INTERCEPTOR_COMMON_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_INTERCEPTOR_COMMON_H

// Includes the main interceptor common functionality header
// This provides common definitions and utilities needed for gRPC interceptors
#include <grpcpp/impl/interceptor_common.h>

// End of header guard
#endif  // GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_INTERCEPTOR_COMMON_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice and file context
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. The significance of the included header file
4. The closing of the header guard

The comments are kept concise while providing essential information about each part of this boilerplate header file. The main purpose of this file appears to be providing a level of indirection to the actual interceptor implementation header while maintaining consistent naming conventions.
