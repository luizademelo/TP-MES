Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_HOOK_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_CALL_HOOK_H

// Includes the main implementation of call hooks functionality for gRPC
// This provides the necessary declarations and definitions for call hook mechanisms
#include <grpcpp/impl/call_hook.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (standard C++ practice to prevent multiple inclusions)
2. The significance of the included file (main implementation of call hooks for gRPC)
3. The closing of the header guard

I've kept the original copyright notice intact as it's important legal information. The comments are concise but explain the essential elements of this header file.
