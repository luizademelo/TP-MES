Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SLICE_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SLICE_H

// Includes the public header file that provides the Slice functionality
// This is the public interface that should be used by clients
#include <grpcpp/support/slice.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (preventing multiple inclusions)
2. The inclusion of the public header file that provides the actual Slice functionality
3. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical header file structure in C++ projects, where this appears to be an internal implementation file that simply includes the public-facing header. The comments help future developers understand:
- Why the header guard exists
- Where the actual functionality is implemented
- The relationship between this internal header and the public interface
