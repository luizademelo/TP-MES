Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_PROTO_BUFFER_WRITER_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_PROTO_BUFFER_WRITER_H

// Includes the main implementation of the protobuf writer support
// This is the public-facing header that provides the ProtoBufferWriter functionality
#include <grpcpp/support/proto_buffer_writer.h>

#endif  // GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_PROTO_BUFFER_WRITER_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included header provides
4. The closing of the header guard with a matching comment

This is a typical C++ header file structure that:
- Prevents multiple inclusions
- Serves as a forwarding header to the actual implementation
- Maintains clean organization of the codebase
