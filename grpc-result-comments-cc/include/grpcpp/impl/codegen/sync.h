Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2019 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SYNC_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SYNC_H

// Includes the main synchronization implementation header for gRPC C++
// This is the actual implementation that contains synchronization primitives
// and utilities used throughout gRPC's codebase
#include <grpcpp/impl/sync.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. What the included header file contains
3. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical header file structure in C++ that:
- Protects against multiple inclusions
- Serves as a forwarding header to the actual implementation
- Follows standard C++ header conventions
