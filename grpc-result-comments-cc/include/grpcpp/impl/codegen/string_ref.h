Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_STRING_REF_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_STRING_REF_H

// Includes the actual string_ref implementation from the support directory
// This is a common pattern where a codegen header includes the real implementation
#include <grpcpp/support/string_ref.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (a standard C++ practice to prevent multiple inclusions)
2. The pattern being used where this codegen header simply includes the real implementation from another location
3. The closing of the header guard

The code appears to be part of gRPC's C++ implementation, specifically dealing with string references. This header serves as a bridge between generated code and the actual implementation.
