Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2019 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_CALLBACK_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_SERVER_CALLBACK_H

// Includes the main server callback support functionality from gRPC
// This provides the base implementations for server-side callback mechanisms
#include <grpcpp/support/server_callback.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (standard practice in C/C++ to prevent duplicate includes)
2. The significance of including the server_callback.h file
3. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a thin wrapper that primarily serves to include the main server callback implementation while providing proper header guards. This is a common pattern in library code to organize functionality while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
