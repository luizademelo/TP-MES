Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_METHOD_HANDLER_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_METHOD_HANDLER_H

// Includes the main method handler support functionality from gRPC
// This provides base classes and utilities for implementing gRPC method handlers
#include <grpcpp/support/method_handler.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. What the included file provides
3. The closing of the header guard
4. Maintains the original copyright notice

The code appears to be part of gRPC's C++ implementation, specifically dealing with method handlers which are fundamental to gRPC's RPC mechanism. The header guard is a standard C++ practice to prevent multiple inclusion, and this file primarily serves to include the main method handler support functionality from gRPC's support library.
