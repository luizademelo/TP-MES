Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_ASYNC_GENERIC_SERVICE_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_ASYNC_GENERIC_SERVICE_H

// Includes the main interface for asynchronous generic services in gRPC.
// This provides the base functionality for handling generic RPC calls where
// the request and response types are not known at compile time.
#include <grpcpp/generic/async_generic_service.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. What the included header provides
3. The closing of the header guard
4. Maintains the original copyright notice

The comments are kept concise while providing enough context about the purpose of each part of the code.
