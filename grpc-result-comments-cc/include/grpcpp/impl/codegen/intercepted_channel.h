Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2018 gRPC authors.
// This file is part of the gRPC library implementation.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_INTERCEPTED_CHANNEL_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_CODEGEN_INTERCEPTED_CHANNEL_H

// Includes the actual implementation of the intercepted channel functionality
// This is the main header file that contains the InterceptedChannel class
// definition and related functionality for gRPC's interceptor mechanism
#include <grpcpp/impl/intercepted_channel.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice
2. The purpose of the header guard
3. What the included file contains
4. The closing of the header guard

This is a typical C++ header file structure that:
- Protects against multiple inclusions
- Includes the necessary implementation
- Maintains clean header file organization
