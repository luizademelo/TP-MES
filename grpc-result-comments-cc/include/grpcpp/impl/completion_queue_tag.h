Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_COMPLETION_QUEUE_TAG_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_COMPLETION_QUEUE_TAG_H

// gRPC namespace
namespace grpc {

// Internal implementation details namespace
namespace internal {

// Abstract base class representing a tag that can be associated with
// operations on a CompletionQueue.
// 
// Tags are used to identify and correlate asynchronous operations with their
// results when they complete. This is a key part of gRPC's asynchronous API.
class CompletionQueueTag {
 public:
  // Virtual destructor to ensure proper cleanup of derived classes
  virtual ~CompletionQueueTag() {}

  // Pure virtual method to be implemented by derived classes.
  // Called when the associated operation completes.
  // 
  // Parameters:
  //   tag - Pointer to store the resulting tag (can be modified)
  //   status - Pointer to boolean indicating operation success (true) or failure (false)
  // 
  // Returns:
  //   bool - Whether the operation was successfully finalized
  // 
  // Derived classes implement this to handle operation completion,
  // potentially modifying the tag and interpreting the status.
  virtual bool FinalizeResult(void** tag, bool* status) = 0;
};

} // namespace internal

} // namespace grpc

#endif // GRPCPP_IMPL_COMPLETION_QUEUE_TAG_H
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard
2. The namespace structure
3. The overall purpose of the CompletionQueueTag class
4. The virtual destructor's role
5. The FinalizeResult method's purpose, parameters, and expected behavior
6. The abstract nature of the class and its intended use in gRPC's asynchronous operations

The comments are designed to help future developers understand:
- Why this class exists
- How it fits into gRPC's architecture
- How to properly implement derived classes
- The contract that implementations must fulfill
