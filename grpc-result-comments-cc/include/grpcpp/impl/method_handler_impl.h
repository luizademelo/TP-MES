Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_IMPL_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H
#define GRPCPP_IMPL_METHOD_HANDLER_IMPL_H

// Includes the base method_handler.h file which likely contains
// the core functionality for gRPC method handling
#include <grpcpp/support/method_handler.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The purpose of the header guard (a common C++ pattern to prevent duplicate includes)
2. The significance of including method_handler.h (though we can't see its contents, we know it's part of gRPC's support infrastructure)
3. The closing of the header guard

The file appears to be a simple wrapper header that ensures proper inclusion of the base method handler functionality in the gRPC C++ library.
