Here's the commented version of the code snippet:

```c++
// Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.

// Header guard to prevent multiple inclusions of this header file
#ifndef GRPCPP_SUPPORT_STATUS_H
#define GRPCPP_SUPPORT_STATUS_H

// Includes the implementation of gRPC status functionality
#include <grpcpp/impl/status.h>

// End of header guard
#endif
```

The comments explain:
1. The copyright notice at the top
2. The purpose of the header guard (a common C++ pattern to prevent multiple inclusions)
3. The inclusion of the actual status implementation header
4. The closing of the header guard

The code appears to be part of gRPC's C++ interface, specifically dealing with status handling functionality. The header serves as a facade that includes the actual implementation from another file.
